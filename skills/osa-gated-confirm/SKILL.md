  How OSA's two-turn conversational confirm for destructive System-MCP actions actually works — and the MODEL-BEHAVIOR pitfalls that silently break it. Consult whenever a gated capability (fs.write_file/append/move/delete, the future messages.send) "won't confirm", when a user's "yes" loops or gets denied, when OSA asks permission before acting, when a confirm turn hangs/thrashes, or when adding or gating any destructive OSA tool. Covers the sync POST two-turn confirm vs the WebSocket interrupt()+Allow/Deny path, the call-tool-first rule, the escalate-the-yes-to-cloud rule, and the never-bypass-the-guard rule. These are the fixes from the first live OSA->MCP delete demo (2026-07-12).

# OSA gated-confirm (the two-turn flow + its failure modes)

## The mechanism (sync `POST /api/osa/chat`)

Destructive System-MCP capabilities are guarded. The sync chat route can't block
on a human, so it confirms across TWO turns:

- **Turn 1 (request):** the model CALLS the guarded tool → the capability raises
  `ApprovalRequired` → the route's `approval_fn` DENIES and RECORDS a
  pending-confirm keyed by `thread_id` → OSA relays "needs your OK".
- **Turn 2 (an affirmative WITH a live pending):** `approval_fn` APPROVES for
  that turn and clears the pending → the checkpointed history replays the
  request so the model re-issues the tool and it proceeds.

The **WebSocket** path (`/api/osa/ws/chat`, the app's PRIMARY path) is different
and sturdier: a real LangGraph `interrupt()` parks the run and the app shows
Allow/Deny **buttons** — no dependence on model phrasing. The sync path is the
fallback used by curl and voice, and it's where the pitfalls below bite.

## Pitfall 1 — the confirm never ARMS (model asks BEFORE calling)

**Symptom:** turn 1 returns `tool_trace: []` plus a "shall I?" question; turn 2
"yes" loops or is denied; nothing ever executes.
**Cause:** the pending is recorded ONLY inside `approval_fn`, which only fires
when the model actually CALLS the tool. A polite model (Claude) that asks in
prose first never arms the pending, so "yes" has nothing to approve.
**Fix (prompt, `OSA_SYSTEM` in `agents/osa_agent.py`):** "ALWAYS CALL THE TOOL
FIRST — the guard's DENIED is the confirm signal; never ask without calling."
**Verify:** turn 1 `tool_trace` must contain the tool and `awaiting_confirm` must
be `true`.

## Pitfall 2 — the "yes" turn routes to a weak LOCAL model

**Symptom:** turn 1 arms correctly, but turn 2 "yes" hangs/thrashes (e.g.
`get_time` called ×15, no action, curl times out).
**Cause:** a bare "yes" looks like chit-chat to `pick_model`, so the
tool-RE-issuing turn lands on a local 7B model, which is unreliable at re-calling
tools.
**Fix (route, `gui/sidecar/routes/api_osa.py`):** when
`get_pending(thread_id) is not None AND is_affirmative(message)`, escalate
`chosen` to the cloud brain (`"default"`) unless a cloud model is pinned.
**Verify:** turn 2 `model` is a `claude-*` id and `tool_trace` re-issues the tool.

## Pitfall 3 — the human's approval WORDING isn't recognized (sync path)

**Symptom:** the confirm is armed, the human clearly approves ("I approve"),
but OSA re-denies and asks again — only the literal word "yes" unlocks it.
**Cause:** `is_affirmative` (`api_osa.py`) is an allowlist of phrasings; a
natural approval outside it reads as a non-affirmative turn, which re-arms
the pending instead of approving. (Live-hit 2026-07-12: "I approve" bounced.)
**Fix:** widen `_AFFIRMATIVES` / `_AFFIRM_FIRST_WORDS` / the prefix list —
with WORD-BOUNDARY-safe prefixes (`p + " "`), or "i approved it last week"
becomes a false approve. Add every new phrasing to the
test_phase14b_osa.py parametrize lists in the same change.

## Pitfall 4 — a broad `except` between interrupt() and the graph

**Symptom (WS path):** the tool IS called, but instead of an
`awaiting_confirm` frame the model receives `ERROR running '<cap>': ...` and
confabulates ("hard system block", "deeper permission issue"); no Allow/Deny
renders. **Cause:** `interrupt()` works by RAISING `GraphInterrupt`
(subclass of `GraphBubbleUp`, subclass of `Exception`) from the approval fn
all the way to the graph runner. ANY broad `except Exception` on that path
swallows it. Paid TWICE now: the streaming runner (14x) and `_run_capability`
(15c live, 2026-07-12 — gated capabilities were dead over the app's primary
WS path while legacy `_guarded` tools worked, because `_guarded`'s
approval_fn call sits outside its swallowing try). **Rule:** every layer that
wraps tool execution gets `except GraphBubbleUp: raise` ABOVE its generic
handler, plus a propagation regression test
(`TestWsInterruptPropagation` pattern). And live-test new gated tools over
the WS route, not just curl — curl only exercises the sync path.

## Pitfall 5 — OSA tries to route AROUND its own guard

A denied destructive action must NEVER be re-attempted by another route (e.g.
`run_command` / `rm`). OSA once suggested `rm` to work around a denied delete.
The prompt now forbids it: "NEVER accomplish a denied or blocked action by
another route — working around your own safety guard is forbidden." If you see
OSA proposing a workaround for a BLOCKED/DENIED op, that's a regression here.

## Pitfall 6 — a parked WS interrupt corrupts the shared thread

The WS confirm path parks a real `interrupt()` — an `AIMessage` with the tool
call sits on the checkpointer with NO `ToolMessage` until a resume. Because typed
(WS) and voice/sync (POST) share ONE durable thread, if the user abandons the
confirm and sends a NEW message on the other path, it appends a `HumanMessage`
onto that dangling tool call → `INVALID_CHAT_HISTORY` on every later turn, wedged
durably in MySQL. Fix (2026-07-21): `_heal_pending_interrupt(agent, config)` runs
before BOTH paths append a turn — resume-deny a live interrupt (fail-closed) or
strip a baked dangling call in place. Full write-up + wedged-thread detection in
`osa-chat-dual-path`. Never resume a WS interrupt with anything but a verified
human decision; the heal always denies.

## How to test (LIVE — unit tests can't see model behavior)

These are MODEL-BEHAVIOR bugs: the route mechanism unit-tests stay green while
the live flow fails. Always drive a real turn against a running sidecar:

```
# turn 1 — expect tool_trace:[<tool>], awaiting_confirm:true, file still present
curl -s localhost:5130/api/osa/chat -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"message":"delete <scratch file>","thread_id":"t"}'
# turn 2 — expect model:claude-*, tool re-issued, file GONE
curl -s localhost:5130/api/osa/chat -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"message":"yes","thread_id":"t"}'
```

**Prereqs:**
- **MySQL up** — OSA chat needs the MySQL checkpointer; a down DB fails the turn
  with `2003 (HY000) Can't connect`. Start: `sudo /usr/local/mysql/support-files/mysql.server start`.
- **Sidecar restarted** to load any prompt/route/config change (it doesn't
  hot-reload — see `osa-sidecar-lifecycle`).
- Use a scratch file under `data/osa_scratch/` (writes there auto-run; safe to delete).
