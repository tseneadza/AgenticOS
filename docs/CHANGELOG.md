## 2026-07-07 — OSA brain switching: durable model pin over the per-turn router

Tony can now pin OSA's brain — "switch to Sonnet", "use your local brain",
"back to auto" — instead of always riding the automatic per-turn router.
A pin covers ALL conversational turns; a *local* pin keeps the tool guardrail
(tool-worthy turns still escalate to Claude — 7B local models are unreliable
tool-callers — and OSA says so in one short spoken clause: "Took Claude for
that one."). Pin cleared ⇒ today's router, untouched.

- **Pin store** (`gui/sidecar/osa_settings.py`, new): single source of truth —
  `get_model_pin()` / `set_model_pin()` over a new MySQL `osa_settings`
  key-value table (`models.OsaSetting`, key `model_pin`; materialised by
  `create_all`, no ALTERs — noted in `migrations.py`). Read-once in-process
  cache so per-turn reads never hit MySQL; DB down ⇒ auto + in-memory writes,
  never raises. Validation at the door: unknown id ⇒ `UnknownBrainError`
  listing the valid brains; known-but-unrunnable (no_api_key / ollama_off /
  not_installed / too_large from `llm.list_models`) ⇒ `UnavailableBrainError`
  with the reason — a dead brain is never pinned. `resolve_brain()` maps
  spoken names ("sonnet", "haiku", "local", "qwen", "fast", "auto") to
  registry ids; ambiguous ("claude") comes back as a question.
- **Routing** (`agents/osa_agent.py`): `pick_model` gains `pin=` — cloud pin
  ⇒ that id every turn; local pin ⇒ pin for chit-chat, `default` for
  tool-worthy turns and when Ollama is down; no pin ⇒ heuristic unchanged.
- **`switch_model` chat tool** (`OSAToolbox`, registered in `build_tools` +
  the OSA_SYSTEM tool map): fuzzy target, persona confirmations, unknown /
  ambiguous / unavailable replies conversational. Same `_guarded` plumbing as
  every tool; not approval-gated (not destructive).
- **API** (`routes/api_osa.py`): `GET /api/osa/model` (pin + mode + registry
  choices with availability/reason — no ensure-Ollama spawn, stays cheap) and
  `POST /api/osa/model` (`{model: "<id>"|"auto"}`; 422 unknown, 409
  unavailable-with-reason). Both registered in `HubApiExplorer.jsx`.
  `/api/osa/state` now carries `pinned_model` (null = auto); the chat
  response adds `pinned_model` + `escalated`, and `route` now reflects what
  the turn ACTUALLY used so the Agent view's badge stays honest under a pin.
- **Rail Brain picker** (`OSARail.jsx`, presence block under "Brief me"):
  compact "Brain" line + native select — Auto + registry models, unavailable
  entries disabled with the reason as title. ONE lightweight GET on mount +
  after changes (not the 12s events poll); POST on change; sidecar down ⇒ the
  line hides (silent degrade). Theme tokens only.
- **Tests**: pytest 386 (+58 — `test_osa_brain_switch.py`: pin CRUD +
  persistence on `agenticos_test`, cache, DB-down degrade, validation,
  resolve_brain, pick_model matrix, switch_model tool, model routes, state
  field, pin-aware chat + escalation clause); vitest 603 (+5 — brain picker
  render/disabled/pinned/POST/degrade).

## 2026-07-07 — Brief-me-now: on-demand OSA briefing (endpoint + rail button)

Tony's first live look at the rail found OSA silent — correctly (zero apps
under health monitoring ⇒ the proactive pipeline had no input), but with no
way to make it speak on demand. This adds one.

- **`POST /api/osa/briefing`** (`routes/api_osa.py`): compose + record a
  status briefing NOW. Always announced — `post_briefing()` gained
  `force_announce=True`, bypassing the quiet-hours/activity check (an
  explicit ask is its own proof of activity; unsolicited speech keeps the
  policy). Forced briefs still stamp the rate-limit window. Also fires
  `note_chat_turn()` (activity signal). Registered in `HubApiExplorer.jsx`.
- **Rail "Brief me" button** (`OSARail.jsx`, presence block under the orb):
  quiet pill button, in-flight guard ("One moment…", disabled), silent
  degrade on error, hidden when no `onBrief` handler.
- **Shared-cursor plumbing** (`App.jsx`): `requestBriefing` POSTs, records
  the entry into the feed, advances the events-bridge `after` cursor past it
  (new optional `cursorRef` prop on `OSAEventsBridge`), then `speak()`s the
  text immediately — no double-speak when the 12s poll comes around;
  `recordOsaEvents` now dedupes by id.
- **Tests**: pytest 328 (+4 — force beats quiet+asleep, rate-limit stamp,
  route always-announces + records, activity note); vitest 598 (+3 — button
  render/hide, in-flight disable + single-call, reject releases).

## 2026-07-07 — Phase 14d SCAFFOLD: OSA voice pipeline skeleton (no live audio)

The voice subsystem's skeleton lands: package, feature flag, sidecar wiring,
API stubs, tests. NO live audio this change — the openWakeWord /
faster-whisper / Piper stages are documented stubs (`NotImplementedError`,
always caught) until the on-device implementation pass; Tony verifies
mic/speaker on his Mac. The sidecar remains fully functional with zero voice
deps installed and the flag off (the default).

- **`osa_voice/`** (new package, repo root per design doc §2):
  `voice_available()` probes the optional deps via `find_spec` (no import
  side effects, never raises, reports missing pip names); `get_service()`
  singleton; `config.py` reads the new `voice:` Constitution block (cached,
  mirrors 14e `notifications_config`); `pipeline.py` `VoiceService` state
  machine — `disabled / idle / listening / transcribing / speaking / error`,
  `start/stop/push_to_talk/set_mute/state()`, `mark()` monotonic latency
  stamps (§3.4 budget in the docstring). Stage stubs `_wake_loop`,
  `_capture_utterance`, `_transcribe`, `_synthesize` carry the full §3 design
  (rolling wake buffer, webrtcvad end-of-speech, whisper worker thread, Piper
  + barge-in) and the utterance→agent contract: transcripts POST through the
  SAME `/api/osa/chat` turn as typed input, then the reply is synthesized.
  Failures park the service in `error` with a reason — never an exception out.
- **Constitution**: new `voice:` block in `config/constitution.yaml` +
  `DEFAULT_VOICE` merge in `core/constitution.py` (exact 14e notifications
  pattern — pre-14d YAMLs keep loading). Knobs: `enabled` (**hard default
  false**), `wake_word: "osa"`, `stt_model: "small"`, `piper_voice: ""`
  (TBD — audition later), `push_to_talk_only: true` (§9 Q3 unresolved — no
  always-listening until Tony opts in), `mute: false`.
- **Sidecar** (`app.py`): `_start_osa_voice` startup hook (briefing-hook
  pattern) — flag off ⇒ debug log, no task; enabled + deps missing ⇒ warning
  with the missing list, service in `error`, sidecar unaffected; enabled +
  deps ok ⇒ `service.start()` off-loop via `asyncio.to_thread`, handle on
  `app.state.osa_voice_task` (also added to the shutdown cancel list).
- **Routes** (`routes/api_osa_voice.py`, new — voice kept out of the
  chat-focused `api_osa.py`): `GET /api/osa/voice/state` (snapshot +
  Constitution `enabled` flag), `POST /api/osa/voice/ptt` (409 with reason
  while disabled / deps missing / skeleton), `POST /api/osa/voice/mute`
  (`{mute: bool}` — works even while disabled, runtime-only). All three
  registered in `HubApiExplorer.jsx`.
- **Deps declared, NOT installed**: `requirements-voice.txt` (openwakeword,
  faster-whisper, piper-tts, sounddevice, webrtcvad) — optional extras for
  the existing `.venv`, on-device only (§10); base `requirements.txt`
  untouched. `osa_voice/README.md` has Tony's on-device setup steps + the
  latency budget table.
- **Tests**: `test_phase14d_voice_scaffold.py` — flag-off default (fresh +
  pre-14d YAML merge), `voice_available()` with deps absent, service
  lifecycle (disabled stays disabled; enabled-but-missing ⇒ `error` with
  reason; PTT stub ⇒ caught `not_implemented`; mute flip; `state()` shape;
  `mark()` stamps), routes via TestClient (state shape, ptt 409, mute flip),
  startup hook (flag off ⇒ no task; deps-missing ⇒ logs, no raise).

## 2026-07-07 — OSA right rail (14e follow-on): orb + proactive feed panel

The OSA orb moves out of its floating overlay into a dedicated right rail — a
fixed 220px column on EVERY view, including Agent (previously the orb hid
there). Frontend-only; backend untouched.

- **`OSARail.jsx`** (new, `gui/desktop/src/components/`): sectioned column —
  (1) presence block: the 14c reactor orb + caption/status; (2) **proactive
  feed**: recent `GET /api/osa/events` messages (downs / recoveries /
  briefings), newest first, bounded to the freshest 20, relative timestamps
  ("2m ago", 30s refresh tick), announced messages visually distinct via a
  state-hue accent bar (downs amber `--osa-think`, recoveries green
  `--osa-listen`, briefings cyan `--osa-idle`) on a `--bg-panel` chip; empty
  state "Nothing to report." in OSA's voice. Rail is fixed, only the feed list
  scrolls. Structure is deliberately `rail-section` blocks so future blocks
  (Tony mentioned vitals) drop in between presence and feed. Scoped `<style>`
  (conventions rule 3), theme tokens only, `prefers-reduced-motion` guard.
  **Responsive floor: below 900px the rail hides entirely** (media query in
  the component) rather than crushing the views.
- **Shared poll, no double-polling**: `OSAEventsBridge` gained an optional
  `onMessages(msgs)` callback — the ONE `/api/osa/events` poll now feeds both
  the speak/caption logic (unchanged: announced → speak, silent → caption,
  priming never speaks) AND the rail feed. `onMessages` receives every batch
  *including* the priming one, so buffered history shows in the feed without
  ever being spoken. App.jsx accumulates the batches (bounded slice(-20)) and
  exposes them as `events` on `OSAContext` (backward-compatible — default
  `[]`; `setOsaState`/`speak` API untouched, AgentView unmodified).
- **`OSAOrb.jsx`**: converted from absolute pinning (top 56px / right 16px /
  z-50) to static flow — flex column, reactor in a fixed 118px `orb-stage`
  (keeps the glow inset tracking the reactor, not the caption), caption
  centered below. Animations, data-state machine, `/api/osa/state` status
  poll, and the public props are unchanged — all 10 existing orb tests pass
  unmodified.
- **Shell (`App.jsx` / `App.css`)**: the floating `<OSAOrb>` mount and its
  `active.id !== "agent"` hide-rule are gone; `.shell`'s flex row is now
  sidebar · `.main` · `<OSARail>` (`.main` keeps `min-width: 0` so existing
  views shrink cleanly at the reduced width). Orb click still jumps to the
  Agent view. The HUD window (`HudOsaPresence`) is untouched — separate
  window, keeps its own slim orb + poll.
- **Tests**: new `OSARail.test.jsx` (12 — orb + caption render, state
  pass-through, empty state, newest-first ordering + relative timestamps,
  announced styling, feed bound, onOpen click, `fmtRel` table incl. bad-ts
  fallback); `OSAEventsBridge.test.jsx` +2 (priming batch reaches
  `onMessages` while still never spoken + announced still speaks from the one
  shared poll; empty polls skip `onMessages`, prop optional). **Suites green:
  `595 passed` (vitest, was 581), `297 passed` (pytest, untouched).**

## 2026-07-07 — Phase 14e: OSA HUD presence + proactive monitoring

OSA now speaks up unprompted — health transitions and a daily briefing surface
through the orb caption on every non-Agent view and through a new compact HUD
presence. Never annoying: balanced level, quiet hours, rate limit.

- **Proactive monitor** (`gui/sidecar/osa_proactive.py`, new): the 13e health
  poller's `"app:port up|down"` transitions become OSA-voiced messages
  (down: "Tony — worldwise just went down (port 5150)."; up: "worldwise is
  back up.") in an in-memory ~50-message ring buffer
  (`{id, ts, app_id, kind, text, announced}` — `_PENDING_CONFIRM` precedent,
  no new DB tables). Policy engine (pure functions, injectable clock):
  **balanced level** — down + up (recovery) announce, everything else records
  silently; **quiet hours 22:00–08:00 local, activity-aware** (Tony's a night
  owl) — downgraded to silent UNLESS Tony is active per HID idle
  (`ioreg -c IOHIDSystem`, active < 10 min idle) → last `/api/osa/chat` turn
  within 30 min (`note_chat_turn` hook in `osa_chat`) → fail-open active;
  **rate limit** — max 1 announced message per app per 5 min (flaps recorded
  silently, silenced messages don't consume the window). Knobs live in
  `config/constitution.yaml` under a new `notifications:` block;
  `core/constitution.py` gained `DEFAULT_NOTIFICATIONS` + a `notifications`
  field merged over defaults so pre-14e configs load unchanged.
- **Daily briefing**: `compose_briefing()` (spoken 1–3 sentences from
  `launch_config.list_all_health()` + the project-ledger count, both degrade
  gracefully) + `post_briefing()` (`kind="briefing"`, announced, quiet-hours
  check still applies). Scheduled **in-sidecar** as an asyncio task
  (`_start_osa_briefing` in `app.py`, default 08:30, hourly re-check when
  disabled) — deliberately the 13e poller pattern, NOT a launchd plist via
  `core/scheduler.py` (no install step; noted in the module docstring). The
  health poller feeds `record_transitions` off-loop via `asyncio.to_thread`.
- **API** (`routes/api_osa.py`): new `GET /api/osa/events?after=<id>` →
  `{messages, latest_id}` (cursor semantics; registered in
  `HubApiExplorer.jsx`); `GET /api/osa/state` now carries `latest_event_id`
  so the orb's existing 15s poll can cheaply detect news.
- **Frontend**: `OSAEventsBridge` (exported from `App.jsx`, mounted inside the
  OSA provider) polls events every ~12s with the `after` cursor, skips while a
  chat turn is in flight (`busyRef` ← osaState "thinking"); announced →
  `speak(text)` (14c speaking + caption → idle), silent → caption only; the
  FIRST poll only primes the cursor/caption so buffered history is never
  "spoken" on app start. `speak()` refactored over a shared `setOsaCaption`
  (~90-char trim). **HUD** (`Hud.jsx`): new exported `HudOsaPresence` — a slim
  orb + one-line caption under the brand header (the 118px reactor doesn't fit
  the HUD column) doing its OWN events polling (separate Tauri window); same
  state hues, data-state animation, `prefers-reduced-motion` guard, theme
  tokens only.
- **Tests**: `gui/sidecar/tests/test_phase14e_proactive.py` (58) — parsing/
  phrasing, balanced policy, rate limit (incl. silenced-doesn't-consume),
  quiet hours + activity override + fail-open, ioreg parse, ring buffer +
  `after` cursor, routes via TestClient, briefing composition/policy, config
  defaults/merge/fallback. Vitest: `OSAEventsBridge.test.jsx` (6) +
  `HudOsaPresence.test.jsx` (5). **Suites green: `297 passed` (pytest),
  `581 passed` (vitest).**

## 2026-07-07 — Phase 14b: OSA more tools + destructive-action confirmation

Extends OSA (14a) with two read-only tools and a conversational confirm flow
for destructive actions.

- **New OSA tools** (`agents/osa_agent.py`, `OSAToolbox`, registered in
  `build_tools` + named in `OSA_SYSTEM`): `apps_health()` summarizes
  `gui/sidecar/launch_config.list_all_health()` (per-app healthy flag + an
  `unhealthy` list; same source as `GET /api/apps/health`) and
  `list_projects()` wraps the same ledger query that backs `GET /api/projects`
  (compact name/template/subfolder/port; degrades to empty if the DB is down).
  Both are read-only (`self._run`, no guard). `web_news` was **deferred** — the
  news routes only expose feed/category CRUD (`news_db`), with no trivial
  synchronous callable to fetch/list current news items, so no fetcher was
  invented.
- **Destructive-action confirmation:** `config/constitution.yaml` gained
  `app_stop` ("Stopping a running app") in `approval_required` (`app_start` left
  out — starting isn't destructive), so `OSAToolbox.stop_app` (which guards with
  `app_stop`) now raises `ApprovalRequired`. The sync `/api/osa/chat` route
  (`gui/sidecar/routes/api_osa.py`) confirms across two turns without blocking:
  a small in-process, thread-keyed, TTL-bounded pending store
  (`_PENDING_CONFIRM`, 5-min TTL) plus pure helpers (`is_affirmative`,
  `is_negative`, `record_pending`/`get_pending`/`clear_pending`). On a normal
  turn the agent's `approval_fn` **denies** + records a pending entry (response
  carries `awaiting_confirm: true` + `pending_action`); on the next turn, an
  affirmative WITH a live pending builds an **approving** `approval_fn`, clears
  the pending, and returns `confirmed: true` (the checkpointed history replays
  the request so the model re-issues `stop_app` and it proceeds). A negative
  clears the pending; a bare affirmative with no live pending never approves.
- **Tests**: `gui/sidecar/tests/test_phase14b_osa.py` (31 tests) — new tools
  (patched `launch_config`/`db.SessionLocal`), `app_stop` guard (denied vs
  approved against the live constitution), the confirm helpers + pending store
  (incl. TTL expiry), and the two-turn route confirm via TestClient (agent +
  checkpointer patched, no live LLM/MySQL). **Suite green: `230 passed`.**

## 2026-07-07 — Phase 14a: OSA assistant — text MVP (agent + routes)

First slice of Phase 14 (OSA, the JARVIS-style assistant): type to OSA, it
replies in its persona and can drive one control tool. No voice (that's 14d).

- **Soul fork** (locked decision — OSA-only sharp persona): the sharp OSA
  persona moved to `config/Soul_OSA.md`; `config/Soul.md` was restored to the
  plainer pre-rewrite identity (recovered from git HEAD) so the governor +
  briefing agents get the shared, plainer soul again. `core/soul.py` gained an
  optional `soul_name` parameter on `identity_preamble` / `load_soul` /
  `soul_path` (defaults to `Soul.md`; governor/briefing call the no-arg form
  unchanged). Memory (`Memory.md`) stays shared across all agents.
- **`agents/osa_agent.py`** — dedicated LangGraph ReAct agent tuned for OSA:
  spoken-style, status-first system prompt on top of the `Soul_OSA.md` preamble
  + a tool manifest (mirrors the governor). A plain, LangChain-free `OSAToolbox`
  of guarded, string-returning tools (`system_health`, `app_status`,
  `start_app`, `stop_app`, `remember`) wraps existing capability
  (`gui/sidecar/panels.py`, `core/process_manager.py`, `core/soul.py`); every
  side-effectful call passes `constitution.guard` like the governor. `build_agent`
  compiles the graph with the MySQL checkpointer (`core.memory.get_checkpointer`)
  under a per-conversation `thread_id` so threads are durable.
- **Model routing (decision #6):** `route_turn` / `pick_model` — a cheap, pure,
  unit-tested classifier picks `local` (Ollama) for chit-chat/acks and `default`
  (Claude) for reasoning + any tool-worthy turn.
- **Ollama ensure-on-OSA-init (decision #9):** `warm_ollama()` calls
  `core.llm.ensure_ollama_running()` at most once per process (best-effort,
  cached, non-blocking). If Ollama can't come up, local turns fall back to
  Claude — OSA never hard-fails. Tested up, down, and binary-missing.
- **`gui/sidecar/routes/api_osa.py`** — `POST /api/osa/chat`
  (`{message, thread_id?}` → spoken reply + tool trace; warms Ollama, routes,
  runs the checkpointed graph) and `GET /api/osa/state` (active model, Ollama
  up/warmed, ready flag). Registered in `gui/sidecar/app.py` and in
  `gui/desktop/src/components/HubApiExplorer.jsx` (api-registry rule).
- **Tests**: `gui/sidecar/tests/test_phase14a_osa.py` (44 tests) — routing,
  toolbox guard/approval/`remember`, warm-on-init (up/down/missing/exception),
  routes via TestClient (agent + checkpointer patched, no live LLM/MySQL), and
  the soul fork. **Suite green: `199 passed`.**

## 2026-07-04 — fix: RAM used/percent now consistent in System Health + Diagnostics

The System Health panel and the expanded Diagnostics MEMORY row read the same
`ram` object from `panels.system_health()`, which reported `used_gb` from
psutil `vm.used` while the percentage came from `vm.percent`. Those are
different measures — `vm.percent` is `(total - available) / total`, not
`used / total` — so on macOS the number and the percent disagreed badly
(e.g. `6.8 / 17.2 GB (76%)`, though 6.8/17.2 is ~40%). `used_gb` is now
`total - available`, so the GB figure and the percentage line up
(`~13 / 17.2 GB (76%)`). One backend change fixes both consumers; no frontend
edit needed. Comment in `panels.py` documents the macOS gotcha.

## 2026-07-03 — Phase 13f: SQLAlchemy consolidation (data layer unified)

The last two raw-SQL stores and the final `mysql.connector` bootstrap are
retired — SQLAlchemy is now the sole MySQL access layer everywhere.

- **`gui/sidecar/models.py`**: added full ORM models `NewsCategory`
  (`news_categories`), `NewsFeed` (`news_feeds`), and `Task` (`tasks`),
  mirroring the live schema exactly. ENUM columns are portable `String(32)`
  validated in Python; `created_at`/`updated_at` use `server_default=func.now()`
  (tasks.`updated_at` also `onupdate=_utcnow`). Unique constraint on
  `news_categories.name`; indexes match live.
- **`gui/sidecar/routes/news_db.py`**: rewritten on the ORM (session-per-call).
  Public API + return shapes unchanged, so `routes/api_news.py` needs no edits;
  joined-feed dicts still carry `domain`/`color`, `enabled` stays a real bool,
  seed catalogue preserved verbatim. `ensure_schema()` now delegates table
  creation to `db.init_db()` then seeds.
- **`gui/sidecar/routes/tasks_db.py`**: rewritten on the ORM. Same public API;
  priority ordering via `func.field(...)`, `task_stats()` computed with
  `func.sum(case(...))` and cast to `int` (was Decimal).
- **`gui/sidecar/db.py`**: retired raw `mysql.connector` — `CREATE DATABASE`
  and the availability ping now run through a server-level SQLAlchemy engine
  (no database selected). `init_db()` stays idempotent/non-raising; the
  Phase 13a ALTER migration step is intact.
- **Tests**: `test_phase11a.py` + `test_phase11c.py` converted off in-memory
  SQLite onto the conftest MySQL fixtures (`agenticos_test`), so they skip
  cleanly when MySQL is down and test what production runs.
- **Suites green**: `155 passed`. Frontend untouched (no JS/JSX changes);
  Phase 13 is now CLOSED.

## 2026-07-03 — Version sync: one number everywhere (0.2.0) + light-theme nav fix

- **Versions had drifted to 4 values across 5 declarations** (v0.4 brand
  badge hardcoded in App.jsx/Hud.jsx, 0.2.0 tauri.conf.json + sidecar
  FastAPI, 0.1.0 package.json + Cargo.toml) — surfaced by the new Settings
  Diagnostics row. All set to **0.2.0** (Tony's call).
- **`scripts/sync_version.py`** (new): `gui/desktop/package.json` is the
  single source of truth; script rewrites tauri.conf.json, Cargo.toml,
  Cargo.lock (desktop entry), and sidecar `FastAPI(version=)`. Modes:
  sync / `--set X.Y.Z` / `--bump major|minor|patch` / `--check` (exit 1 on
  drift). Errors loudly if a target's pattern is missing.
- **App.jsx + Hud.jsx brand badges** now render `v{pkg.version}` from
  package.json — no more hand-edited version strings in JSX.
- **`docs/VERSIONING.md`** (new): procedure + bump policy — minor per
  completed roadmap phase, patch for fixes between phases.
- **Light-theme fix** (separate commit `3f94fcf`): `.nav-item.active`,
  `.nav-item:hover`, `.side-item:hover`, `.approval` used hardcoded dark
  hexes — unreadable dark-on-dark chips on light themes; now derived from
  the active theme via color-mix.

## 2026-07-03 — Settings rework: every setting now drives real behavior

The Phase 9 Settings page saved API keys + toggles to
`localStorage["agentic-os.settings"]` that NOTHING consumed (dark_mode
duplicated theme.js, keys sat in plaintext, intervals were ignored).
Rebuilt so every control is wired end-to-end:

- **`gui/desktop/src/settings.js`** (new): settings registry mirroring
  theme.js — load/save/subscribe on one localStorage key + derived helpers
  `pollMs(base)` (Slow 2× / Normal / Fast ½× scaling) and `sidecarUrl()` /
  `sidecarWsUrl()` / `sidecarHost()` (validated, trailing-slash-stripped,
  falls back to http://localhost:5130). Loads PURGE the legacy Phase 9
  fields — stored plaintext API keys are dropped from disk on first read.
- **`gui/desktop/src/components/EnvironmentPanel.jsx`**: rewritten —
  Appearance (8-theme picker via the `__agenticOsSetTheme` bridge, FR-60,
  native View ▸ Theme menu + HUD stay in sync), Polling speed, Sidecar
  connection (URL + Test button + Default), read-only Diagnostics (sidecar
  online/offline, URL, app version, active theme, localStorage usage).
  API-key fields and dead toggles removed. Scoped `sv-*` stylesheet
  (conventions rule 3).
- **Consumers wired — sidecar URL now read lazily per request** (applies
  without reload): `api.js` (get/post/AG-UI WS), `utils/explorers.js`
  `buildUrl`, HubApiExplorer (status pill label + probe), ScriptsExplorer,
  ToolCallVisualizer, SelfDiagnosticsView (diagnostics WS + error message).
  Hub `:8085` references deliberately untouched (decommissioned — later
  phase).
- **Poll intervals scaled by `pollMs()`**: ProjectsView (5s/2s status,
  10s health), HubApiExplorer + ScriptsExplorer server checks (5s),
  WorkflowsWorkspace + ToolCallVisualizer runs/steps (4s/2s). Base values
  unchanged at Normal; open views pick up a new speed on remount.
- **Tests**: `settings.test.js` (13, new), `EnvironmentPanel.test.jsx`
  (16, rewritten), `SettingsView.integration.test.jsx` (13, rewritten —
  covers the click → settings.js → consumer chain). Old 73 tests asserted
  the dead Phase 9 contract; suite now 553 vitest green + 155 pytest green,
  vite build clean.

## 2026-07-03 — Phase 13e: Integration Testing + Active Health Polling

- **`gui/sidecar/launch_config.py`**: `run_health_checks()` — polls the HTTP
  health endpoint of every pid-verified running `app_processes` row.
  Config resolution: `app_health_checks` row for (app_id, port) first
  (endpoint/method/expected/timeout/interval), launch-time
  `health_check_url` fallback (GET/200/5s/10s), neither → left alone
  (optional-table contract). Respects per-row `interval_seconds`; sweeps
  dead-pid rows; records up/down transitions. Updates `is_healthy` +
  `last_health_check` (stored with `microsecond=0` — MySQL DATETIME rounds
  .5s+ UP, which put stamps in the future and skipped the next pass).
  `list_all_health()` — one-query per-app aggregation.
- **`gui/sidecar/app.py`**: `_start_health_poller` startup hook — 10s
  background task running `run_health_checks` in a worker thread;
  best-effort, MySQL down never kills the loop.
- **`gui/sidecar/routes/api_apps.py`**: `GET /api/apps/health` (fixed path
  before `/{app_id}`) — aggregated health, degrades without MySQL.
  Registered in HubApiExplorer (api-registry rule).
- **`gui/desktop/src/components/ProjectsView.jsx`**: ♥ health chip on
  running cards with HTTP health data (10s poll of `/api/apps/health`;
  per-port tooltip), health ✓/✗/— column in the expanded process table.
- **`gui/sidecar/scripts/seed_health_checks.py`** (new): probe-verified
  seeding — for each typed ledger port that is LIVE, candidates
  `/api/health → /health → /docs → /` probed and the first 200 wins; no
  guessed rows. Dry-run default, `--apply` commits, idempotent.
  **Applied 2026-07-03:** 5 endpoints seeded (agenticos-sidecar:5130,
  battester:8090, hub:8085, keno:5100 — only `/` answers there —
  mazegame:5107); 24 apps not running (re-run while up).
- **`gui/sidecar/tests/test_phase13e.py`** (new): 10 tests — the full e2e
  chain against a real fake-app HTTP server (launch via launch-config →
  wait_for_port → healthy → flip to 500 → down transition → stop → pids
  dead + port free + rows stopped), hard-kill of a SIGTERM-trapping
  process, allocator refusing a live port, poll edge cases
  (no_config/not_due/URL fallback/dead-pid sweep), aggregation exclusions,
  route live+degraded, seeder plan/apply/idempotency.
- Suites: **155 pytest** (stable ×2) / **584 vitest** green; build clean.
- **Watch:** something answers `/api/health` 200 on **:8085** — that's the
  DECOMMISSIONED hub's port. Investigate what's actually running there.

## 2026-07-03 — Phase 13d: Projects GUI

- **`gui/desktop/src/components/ProjectsView.jsx`** (new): card grid over
  the `projects` ledger (`GET /api/projects`, 27 rows) joined with live
  running status from `GET /api/apps` (adaptive 5s/2s polling — the
  in-memory `status_all()` hot path, no per-app DB hits). Start/Stop wired
  to `POST /api/apps/{id}/start|stop`; status badge green (running) /
  yellow (partial — some tracked `app_processes` rows stopped) / red
  (stopped); expandable detail shows the pid-verified process table
  (from `/status`) and the resolved launch plan. Graceful degrades for
  ledger-down, sidecar-down, and not-in-registry projects. Theme tokens
  only; scoped `pv-*` injected stylesheet (frontend conventions rules 1+3).
- **New nav link "Projects"** (GUI principle #7): `App.jsx` VIEWS entry +
  native menu item in `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` (⌘8 — appended after ⌘1–7 so
  existing bindings stay stable; needs a Tauri rebuild to appear in the menu).
- **`gui/sidecar/routes/api_apps.py`**: new `GET /api/apps/{app_id}/launch-plan`
  — thin read-only wrapper over `launch_config.build_launch_command` for the
  expandable card detail. `configured=false` + reason for legacy-launch apps
  (no `app_commands`); `available=false` when MySQL is down; never a 500.
  Registered in `HubApiExplorer.jsx` in the same change (api-registry rule).
- **Locked decision #11 (13c flagged item resolved with Tony): skip both**
  manual `app_commands` rows — `hub` decommissioned (9d), `agenticos`
  self-launch is self-referential. They surface via the `configured=false`
  path in the GUI.
- **Tests:** `test_phase13d.py` (4 pytest — configured plan, unconfigured
  degrade, DB-down degrade, 404) + `ProjectsView.test.jsx` (7 vitest —
  cards, badges incl. partial, expand detail + plan, no-config note,
  start/stop POSTs, ledger-down degrade). Suites: **145 pytest** (stable
  ×2) / **581 vitest** green; `npm run build` + `cargo check` clean.

## 2026-07-03 — Phase 13c: Launch-System Execution Layer

- **`core/process_manager.py`** (extended — ONE launch system, PHASE13 doc
  §Locked Decisions #1): `start()` now asks
  `launch_config.build_launch_command()` for a data-driven multi-step launch
  plan first (per-step cwd/env/venv-rewrite, `wait_for_completion` steps run
  to exit — nonzero code or timeout aborts and kills already-started
  siblings, `wait_for_port` polls up to the step's timeout); apps with no
  launch config (or MySQL down) fall back to the legacy registry path.
  Broken configs (unresolved template variable) surface as an error status —
  never silently bypassed. Every spawn keeps `start_new_session=True`; stop
  is now a **process-group kill** (`os.killpg` SIGTERM → 5s grace → SIGKILL,
  locked decision #5) for both paths, and additionally sweeps DB-known
  running pids the in-memory table lost (orphans from a previous sidecar
  life). Launches persist to `app_processes` via
  `launch_config.record_process`/`mark_process_stopped` (best-effort — DB
  down never blocks a launch). Internal `_procs` is now `app_id → [entries]`
  (multi-process apps); `status()` merges pid-verified `app_processes` rows
  (new `processes` list in the ProcessStatus shape; `status_all()` stays
  DB-free for the hot path); `stop()` responses add `killed_pids`.
- **`gui/sidecar/app.py`**: new startup hook `_reconcile_stale_processes`
  wires `launch_config.reconcile_stale_processes()` — orphaned 'running'
  rows are swept at sidecar startup (locked decision #7). Best-effort.
- **`gui/sidecar/routes/api_apps.py`**: new `GET /api/apps/processes`
  (all DB-tracked running processes, pid-verified, doc contract; degrades
  gracefully without MySQL). Existing `/start|stop|status` routes evolved by
  the manager changes above — no parallel `/launch` surface (locked
  decision #1). Registered in `HubApiExplorer.jsx` in the same change
  (api-registry rule).
- **`gui/sidecar/tests/test_phase13c.py`** (new): 12 MySQL-backed tests
  spawning real short-lived processes — multi-step launch + persistence +
  stop, failing-completion-step abort, broken-template surfacing,
  process-group kill reaches children (pgrep -g proof), `wait_for_port`
  end-to-end against a real bound socket, legacy registry fallback,
  DB-orphan sweep on stop, `/api/apps/processes` live + degraded,
  status-route DB merge, startup reconcile. Suite: **141 passed** (stable
  ×2); `npm run build` clean.
- **Deferred to a follow-up (flagged):** manual `app_commands` rows for
  `agenticos` + `hub` — what "launching agenticos" means (the sidecar
  launching itself?) needs Tony's call.

## 2026-07-03 — Phase 13b: Launch-Config Backfill Script

- **Decisions locked with Tony** (recorded in the PHASE13 doc §Locked
  Decisions): **port_type semantics** — browser-facing port → `frontend`
  (even when FastAPI/Flask serves the UI, so single-port apps like keno are
  `frontend`), API-only port behind a separate frontend → `backend`,
  headless service (agenticos-sidecar :5130, dreamcatcher-backend :5111) →
  `api`; **no-start.sh apps** get ONE app_commands step from the registry's
  `start_command` (app.json `web.command`); **start.sh-only ports** (e.g.
  worldwise backend :8000) are allocated on `--apply` through the ONE
  allocator (`project_manager.allocate_port(app_id, preferred_port=...)`)
  and stamped with their port_type — if the preferred port is unavailable
  the mismatch is logged to `port_collision_log` and the command stays
  templated with the port-type variable so it resolves to the ALLOCATED
  port.
- **`gui/sidecar/scripts/backfill_launch_config.py`** (new; package
  `gui/sidecar/scripts/`): `python -m gui.sidecar.scripts.backfill_launch_config`
  — **dry-run by default**, `--apply` commits. Conservative start.sh parser
  (allow-listed launch commands; tracks `cd`/env/export/inline env,
  background `&`, shell-variable + `$SCRIPT_DIR`-style substitution; ignores
  shebang/comments/echo/sleep/lsof-kill/trap/cleanup-functions/wait;
  unrecognized lines reported for review). Ledger cross-check per locked
  decision #3 (13a): own port → templated; foreign port →
  `log_collision(phase='backfill')`, literal kept, never inserted; unknown
  port → planned allocation. Templating emits only variables
  `build_launch_command` can resolve (`{app_path}`, `{venv_path}` only when
  `projects.venv_path` is set, `{<type>_port}`) — no unresolvable tokens.
  Idempotent (existing app_commands rows reported + skipped;
  uk_app_port_type violations reported, not raised). Summary per the doc's
  §Backfill Process step 6; exit 0 even with collisions (logged by design).
  Core logic is pure planning over `(apps, session)` (`build_plan` /
  `apply_plan`) for direct test drive.
- **`gui/sidecar/tests/test_phase13b.py`** (new): 19 MySQL-backed tests —
  worldwise-style 2-step parse (cwd/env/background/variable substitution),
  housekeeping filtering, port_type inference (+ uk conflict skip +
  idempotent second pass), templating (paths/ports/venv-only-when-set),
  collision path (logged, not inserted, literal kept), registry
  start_command fallback, manual-entry edge cases, apply end-to-end
  (extra-port allocation incl. preferred-unavailable →
  `build_launch_command` resolves), second run inserts 0. No real Codehome
  apps: registry entries + start.sh content injected; allocator probes
  monkeypatched.

## 2026-07-02 — Phase 13a: Launch System Schema + Config Layer

- **Decisions locked with Tony** (amendments to
  `docs/PHASE13_DATA_DRIVEN_LAUNCH_SYSTEM.md`): ONE launch system — Phase 13
  extends `core/process_manager.py` + the existing `/api/apps/*` routes (no
  parallel `/launch` surface); the 5 "stored procedures" are **Python
  functions** with the doc's exact JSON contracts (SQLAlchemy, not SQL procs);
  backfill takes **ports from the live registry/ledger**, start.sh is parsed
  for commands only; **MySQL everywhere** — tests run against a real
  `agenticos_test` schema; SQLAlchemy is the sole DB access layer going
  forward (legacy `news_db`/`tasks_db` migration scheduled as Phase 13f;
  LangGraph MySQL checkpointer is a separate future phase).
- **`gui/sidecar/models.py`**: `projects.venv_path`; `ports.port_type` +
  `uk_app_port_type(app_id, port_type)`; new tables `app_commands`,
  `app_processes`, `app_health_checks`, `port_collision_log`. Portable
  String/JSON columns (no MySQL ENUMs); no DB-level FK from ports→projects
  (ledger holds service ports with no projects row).
- **`gui/sidecar/migrations.py`** (new): `ensure_phase13_schema(engine)` —
  idempotent, inspect-first ALTERs for pre-existing tables + create_all for
  new ones; wired into `db.init_db()`. **Applied to the live `agenticos`
  schema**: 4 tables created, 2 columns + 1 unique index added, 0 warnings;
  28 port rows defaulted to `port_type='api'` (13b assigns real types).
- **`gui/sidecar/launch_config.py`** (new): `allocate_ports` (typed,
  idempotent, reuses the ONE allocator in `project_manager`),
  `build_launch_command` (template resolution `{app_path}`/`{venv_path}`/
  `{<type>_port}`, absolute cwd, per-step health-check config, fails loudly
  on unresolved variables), `get_app_status` (pid-verified, marks dead rows
  stopped), plus `record_process` / `mark_process_stopped` /
  `reconcile_stale_processes` / `list_all_processes` / `log_collision` for
  13b/13c.
- **`gui/sidecar/tests/conftest.py`** (new): session-scoped MySQL
  `agenticos_test` fixture (skips cleanly if MySQL down) + function-scoped
  wiping `db_session`.
- **`gui/sidecar/tests/test_phase13a.py`** (new): 20 tests — schema, old-shape
  migration in a scratch DB (incl. idempotency), allocate/build/status/
  reconcile/collision-log. **Suite: 109 passed** (89 existing + 20 new).
- **Noted:** live `agenticos` schema already contains LangGraph
  `checkpoint*` tables — investigate during the checkpointer phase.

## 2026-06-26 — Phase 9d: Hub Decommissioned (FR-64)

- **`config/settings.yaml`**: `hub_url` commented out; `hub_autostart: false`
  added — sidecar no longer spawns Hub binary on boot.
- **`gui/sidecar/app.py`**: `_ensure_hub_running` startup hook converted to
  a no-op controlled by `hub_autostart` flag; legacy path preserved but
  gated behind `hub_autostart: true`.
- **`tools/hub_mcp.py`**: `HUB_URL` annotated as non-load-bearing (used only
  by analytics/env/tags/favorites which degrade gracefully when Hub absent).
- **`hub/docs/PORT_ASSIGNMENTS.md`**: `:8085` marked RETIRED 2026-06-26.
- **Frontend**: rebuilt (`npm run build`) — 40 modules, 672ms, ScriptsExplorer
  ships with native data sources.
- **Cutover smoke test (9/9 passed, Hub cold)**:
  `list_hub_apps` native, `hub_status` native, `build_agent_tool_registry`,
  `build_script_tool_registry` (13 tools), `hub_manifests` (keno block),
  `panels.hub_status`, `GET /api/apps` (27), `GET /api/apps/scripts` (13),
  `POST /api/apps/keno/start|stop` — all pass with `:8085` dead.
- **Git**: `84c1404` — 36 files, 1941 insertions, 3 new files.

## 2026-06-26 — Phase 9c: Native Tool Registry + Scripts Dashboard (FR-62/63)

- **`tools/hub_mcp.py`** (internals swapped): `list_hub_apps`, `hub_status`,
  `_fetch_all_manifests`, `build_agent_tool_registry`, `hub_manifests`,
  `list_hub_scripts` now read from `core/app_registry` +
  `core/process_manager` — no Hub HTTP round-trips. All function signatures
  and the `ACTIONS` dict surface unchanged. Hub HTTP kept as graceful
  fallback if native scan fails. `native: true` flag added to responses
  for observability during parallel-run.
- **`gui/sidecar/routes/api_apps.py`** (extended): added
  `GET /api/apps/scripts/info` (raw script content for header parsing) and
  `POST /api/apps/scripts/run` (sync exec, 30s timeout, venv-aware Python).
  Constitution gate on `POST /api/apps/stop-all`: returns 403 with
  `approval_required` detail; `POST /api/apps/stop-all-confirmed` for
  pre-approved bypass.
- **`ScriptsExplorer.jsx`** (repointed): `HUB` → `SIDECAR` at `localhost:5130`;
  scripts load from `/api/apps/scripts`, info from `/api/apps/scripts/info`,
  run from `/api/apps/scripts/run`. Health dot now probes sidecar not Hub.
- **Smoke test (2026-06-26)**: `list_hub_apps` native=True, 27 apps, 2ms;
  `build_agent_tool_registry` returns `keno__get_draws` natively;
  `list_hub_scripts` 13 scripts native; script info 190 lines + 5 examples;
  script run executed; constitution stop-all gate fires correctly.

## 2026-06-26 — Phase 9b: Native Process Manager (FR-61)

- **`core/process_manager.py`** (new): async process lifecycle manager.
  `asyncio.create_subprocess_exec` with `start_new_session=True`; inherits
  env + injects `PORT`; venv python rewriting mirrors Hub's
  `shouldRewriteWithVenvPython` (python/python3/`.py` → venv python3, shell
  scripts left untouched). Per-app logfile at
  `~/.agentic-os/logs/<app_id>.log`. SIGTERM → 5-second grace → SIGKILL
  (mirrors Hub). Port-probe fallback for Hub-managed apps (`managed: false`).
- **`gui/sidecar/routes/api_apps.py`** (updated): added lifecycle routes
  `POST /api/apps/{id}/start|stop|restart`, `GET /api/apps/{id}/status`,
  `GET /api/apps/{id}/logs`, `POST /api/apps/stop-all`. `GET /api/apps` now
  enriches each entry with live status and returns real `running_count`.
- **Smoke test (2026-06-26)**: Keno started (pid, port 5100, log streaming),
  Flask serving, stop confirmed, restart confirmed; Hub detected as running
  via port-probe (`managed=false`); `running_count` accurate throughout.

## 2026-06-26 — Phase 9a: Native App Registry (FR-60)

- **`core/app_registry.py`** (new): scans `~/Codehome/**/app.json` without
  requiring the external Hub on `:8085`. Normalises all apps into a stable
  `AppEntry` schema (id, name, start_command, expected_port, venv, agent,
  scripts, tags). 60-second TTL cache; `invalidate_cache()` for on-demand
  refresh. Hidden dirs, `venv/`, `node_modules/` auto-skipped. Duplicate id
  detection with warning log.
- **`gui/sidecar/routes/api_apps.py`** (new): four REST endpoints over the
  native registry — `GET /api/apps` (list), `GET /api/apps/{id}` (detail),
  `GET /api/apps/manifests` (agent blocks), `GET /api/apps/scripts` (flat
  script list), `POST /api/apps/refresh` (force rescan).
- **`gui/sidecar/app.py`**: wired `api_apps.router` — additive, no Hub routes
  removed (parallel-run period).
- **`config/settings.yaml`**: added `app_registry.scan_roots` key; annotated
  `hub_url` as Phase-9d-retired.
- **Smoke test (2026-06-26)**: `GET /api/apps` → 27 apps; Keno agent block
  in `/api/apps/manifests`; 13 scripts across all apps; `/api/apps/keno`
  returns venv path + start command correctly.

## 2026-06-24 — SQLite → MySQL migration: Phases 3–6 (checkpointer + cleanup)

- **LangGraph checkpointer is now MySQL** via `langgraph-checkpoint-mysql`'s
  `PyMySQLSaver` (Phase 3). `core/memory.py` `checkpointer_conn()` returns an
  **autocommit PyMySQL** connection and a new `get_checkpointer()` builds the
  saver and runs `setup()` once per process (creates the `checkpoint_*` tables
  in schema `AgenticOS`). `core/orchestrator.py` and `gui/sidecar/runner.py`
  swapped `SqliteSaver` → `memory.get_checkpointer(conn)`; `build_graph()` type
  hint is now `BaseCheckpointSaver`. **No SQLite remains** — `data/state.db` is
  no longer created or read.
- **`/api/runs/{id}/steps` rewritten** (Phase 4): instead of decoding the raw
  SQLite `writes` table with `ormsgpack`, it reads the run's checkpoints through
  the saver's public `list()` API (already-deserialized `(task_id, channel,
  value)` writes) and aggregates them in execution order. The Tool Call
  Visualizer's step contract (`task_id/step/branch_to/tokens/cost_usd/output`)
  is unchanged.
- **Cleanup** (Phase 5): `requirements.txt` drops `langgraph-checkpoint-sqlite`,
  adds `langgraph-checkpoint-mysql[pymysql]` + `PyMySQL` (MySQL ≥ 8.0.19 / MariaDB
  ≥ 10.7.1 required). Updated `docs/state-and-memory.md`, `docs/architecture.md`,
  `README.md`, and `.gitignore`.
- **Data migration** (Phase 6): new `scripts/migrate_state_db_to_mysql.py`
  one-time copies any leftover `run_history` / `briefed_docs` rows from
  `data/state.db` into MySQL (checkpoints are disposable — not migrated).
- **Collation fix:** the `AgenticOS` database defaults to `utf8mb4_unicode_ci`,
  so `setup()` created the `checkpoint_*` tables with that collation, but the
  saver's `JSON_TABLE` comparisons use `utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci` — MySQL raised 1267
  "Illegal mix of collations". `get_checkpointer()` now runs `ALTER TABLE ...
  CONVERT TO ... utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci` on the three checkpoint tables after
  `setup()` (idempotent, once per process; self-heals existing tables).
- **Live-verified** on MySQL 9.4.0: `approval-demo` workflow ran to completion
  through the checkpointer. Still TODO before commit: confirm the Run Visualizer
  (`/api/runs/{id}/steps`) + Agent Activity read back cleanly, confirm no new
  `data/state.db`, optional `scripts/migrate_state_db_to_mysql.py` data copy.

## 2026-06-23 — SQLite → MySQL migration: Phase 1 (run history)

- Plan written: `docs/mysql-migration-plan.md` (inventory of all SQLite usage,
  two categories, phased approach; checkpointer to use `langgraph-checkpoint-mysql`).
- **`core/memory.py` run history + briefing dedupe now live in MySQL** (schema
  `AgenticOS`, tables `run_history` + `briefed_docs`), mirroring tasks_db/news_db.
  Public function signatures unchanged, so `orchestrator`, `runner`, the briefing
  agent, and `/api/runs` need no edits. Added `ensure_schema()` + `activity_stats()`.
- `panels.agent_activity()` reads telemetry via `memory.activity_stats()` instead
  of a direct `sqlite3` query (removed `sqlite3`/`datetime` imports there).
- The LangGraph checkpointer (`memory.checkpointer_conn`, orchestrator/runner
  `SqliteSaver`, `/api/runs/{id}/steps`) **still uses SQLite** — that's Phase 3.
- Carry-forward: existing `data/state.db` run rows aren't auto-copied (one-time
  migration is Phase 6); `brain2_agent.collect_session_summary` imports a `Memory`
  class that has never existed in memory.py (pre-existing latent bug).

## 2026-06-23 — API Explorer covers the sidecar + API-registration rule

- **API Explorer is now multi-server.** `HubApiExplorer.jsx` gained a per-entry
  `server` field; sidecar routes (`:5130`) and Hub routes (`:8085`) both resolve
  to the right base. Added a second health dot (Hub + Sidecar) and renamed the
  view "Codehome API Explorer".
- **Registered the sidecar News API** in the Explorer: `/api/news/categories`,
  `/api/news/feeds` (CRUD), `/api/news/fetch`, `/api/news/rank`, `/api/health`.
- **New governance:** `docs/api-registry.md` + a CLAUDE.md rule require every
  new Codehome/sidecar/Hub endpoint to be registered in the Explorer in the same
  change; documents the recommended `/openapi.json` auto-discovery for the
  sidecar so it stops drifting.

## 2026-06-23 — "Rank with AI" fixed (server-side via core.llm)

- The Web News **Rank with AI** button called `api.anthropic.com` directly from
  the webview (no key, CORS-blocked) — it always failed ("Load failed").
- New `POST /api/news/rank` in `app.py` scores articles through
  `core.llm.complete()` — the unified provider layer the governing agent uses —
  so it honors the app's **active model** (local Ollama or cloud). Returns a
  `scores` array aligned to the posted order + model/provider/cost. Tolerant
  JSON extraction (handles code fences / surrounding prose from local models).
- `WebNewsView.rankWithAI` now POSTs to the sidecar (no API key in the
  frontend) and the button has a tooltip explaining what it does.
- **Verify:** restart the sidecar; ensure the active model is runnable (cloud
  needs `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`; local needs Ollama up).

## 2026-06-23 — Web News feeds moved to MySQL (schema `AgenticOS`) + management UI

- **Feeds + categories are no longer hardcoded.** Migrated the catalogue out of
  `app.py` (`_NEWS_FEEDS`) and `WebNewsView.jsx` (`DOMAIN_COLORS`) into MySQL.
- **New schema `AgenticOS`** (case-insensitive == existing `agenticos`), tables
  `news_categories` + `news_feeds`, self-bootstrapping: `news_db.ensure_schema()`
  creates the DB/tables and seeds the 8 categories + 26 feeds on first run.
- **New files:** `gui/sidecar/routes/news_db.py` (MySQL data layer, mirrors
  `tasks_db.py`) and `routes/api_news.py` (CRUD: `GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE`
  `/api/news/categories` and `/api/news/feeds`). Router mounted in `app.py`;
  schema bootstrapped on startup (best-effort; 503 + frontend fallback if MySQL down).
- **Frontend now data-driven:** `WebNewsView` fetches categories (colors) + feeds
  from the API with a built-in `DEFAULT_CATEGORIES` fallback, and the ⚙ Settings
  drawer gained **Manage Feeds** (add / enable-disable / delete) and **Manage
  Categories** (add with color picker / delete) sections.
- **Verify:** ensure MySQL is running with creds in `~/.agentic-os/.env`, restart
  the sidecar (auto-creates + seeds), then `npm run tauri dev`.

## 2026-06-23 — Web News view polish + GUI frontend conventions

- **WebNews redesign (`gui/desktop/src/components/WebNewsView.jsx`):**
  - Fixed silent style bug — component used undefined `var(--fg)` / `var(--fg-muted)`; switched to theme tokens `--text` / `--text-dim`, restoring visual hierarchy.
  - Domain-colored card stripes, hover lift, refined toolbar pills/buttons, skeleton loading, relative timestamps, scoped `<style>` for real hover/transitions.
  - Article thumbnails (right-aligned, `loading=lazy`, `referrerPolicy=no-referrer`, hide-on-error).
  - "Show more" now gated on measured DOM overflow (not char count); expanded state renders unclamped `pre-wrap` text.
- **Sidecar RSS (`gui/sidecar/app.py`):**
  - New `_extract_image` helper (media:content/thumbnail, enclosure, Atom enclosure link, embedded `<img>`); each item now returns an `image` field.
  - Summary cap raised `[:400]` → `[:2000]` so "show more" reveals full abstracts.
- **Docs:** Added `docs/gui-frontend-conventions.md` (theme tokens, RSS rules, overflow gating, edit-verification) and a GUI/frontend rule section in `CLAUDE.md`.
- **Verify:** restart sidecar to clear the 15-min feed cache, then `cd gui/desktop && npm run tauri dev`.

## 2026-06-19 — v0.4: Scripts Audit System + Codehome Script Discovery + Osa Branding

- **Branding:** Updated sidebar to show "OSA" as primary name (agentic os · v0.4) — makes it clear the app can be addressed as Osa

- **Backend API:** New `/api/scripts` endpoint for discovering and auditing all scripts in ~/Codehome
  - Recursive filesystem scanning with auto-detection of script types (bash, python, node, ruby, go, rust)
  - Metadata extraction: modified date, size, executable status, file path
  - Organized by app (top-level folder in Codehome)
  - Optional `.scripts-metadata.json` for custom descriptions
- **Frontend:** ScriptsView component (500+ lines) with tabbed interface
  - Workflows tab: Browse workflows with usage instructions and metrics
  - All Scripts tab: Two-panel layout (app list | script details)
  - Search/filter functionality for both tabs
  - Error handling and loading states
  - localStorage persistence (active tab, selection, expanded apps)
- **Styling:** 600+ lines of CSS for responsive layout and components
- **Bug Fixes:**
  - Fixed Ollama Host port: 11434 → 12434 (backend + frontend + tests)
  - Fixed date parsing: Unix timestamp * 1000 for milliseconds
  - Added error state tracking for API failures
  - Improved error handling in config test endpoint
- **Tests Updated:** Port references updated across test suite
- **Ready for:** Dev server restart and ALL SCRIPTS tab verification

## 2026-06-19 — Phase 2 GUI Layout Decisions + Implementation Plan (3-sprint roadmap)

- **Scope:** Enhanced Tauri GUI with Environment config tab, Diagnostics sidebar panel, Scripts view, and Hub MCP tool integration.
- **Layout decisions completed (5 questions):**
  - **Sidebar agent cards:** Quick status (🟢/🔴) + cost + [★ Favorites] dropdown for workflow launch
  - **Main panel tabs:** Keep Queue|Logs|Memory|Approvals; add **Environment tab** (LLM model selector, API keys, feature flags)
  - **Logs display:** Logs stay in Logs tab; add **collapsible Diagnostics sidebar panel** for system health (CPU/RAM/Net)
  - **Environment variables:** Integrated into Environment tab (config UI, not CLI)
  - **Scripts & Favorites:** Hub panel for apps; sidebar Favorites dropdown + dedicated **Scripts view** for workflow launcher
- **Implementation plan (3 sprints, 6 weeks):**
  - **Sprint 1 (Weeks 1-2):** Environment tab (LLM config, feature flags) + Diagnostics sidebar (collapse/expand with localStorage)
  - **Sprint 2 (Weeks 3-4):** Scripts view (workflow list + launch) + Enhanced Hub panel (all 35 MCP tools) + Agent card favorites
  - **Sprint 3 (Weeks 5-6):** Integration tests, docs, PR review
- **New files (12):** Frontend components (Environment.jsx, DiagnosticsPanel.jsx, ScriptsView.jsx, hooks); Backend routes (api_config.py, api_workflows.py); Tests
- **Modified files (6):** AgentCard.jsx, TabBar.jsx, App.jsx, Sidebar.jsx, sidecar/app.py, CHANGELOG.md
- **New API endpoints:** GET/PUT `/api/config`, POST `/api/config/test`, GET `/api/workflows`
- **Success criteria:** All 5 decisions answered, Environment tab working, Diagnostics collapse/expand, Favorites launch workflows, Scripts view lists workflows, Hub MCP tools wired, >80% test coverage, docs complete, PR merged.
- **Next phases:** Phase 9 (Hub Absorption) depends on Phase 2 Hub panel ✅; Phase 10+ (Agent Authoring) depends on Phase 2 Scripts view ✅
- **Docs:** `PHASE_2_LAYOUT_DECISIONS.md` (layout interview Q&A), `PHASE_2_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` (detailed breakdown, 3-sprint roadmap)

## 2026-06-19 — Hub MCP extended: 35 tools for app/script/analytics/env management

- **New capability.** Extended the Hub MCP module (`tools/hub_mcp.py`) from 7 tools to **35 tools**, exposing all 27 Hub REST endpoints. Full coverage: app control, details, logs, health, analytics, environment variables, tags, favorites, scripts, and system operations.
- **New tools (28 added):**
  - **Logs & Health:** `get_app_logs(app_id, limit)`, `get_app_health(app_id)`
  - **Analytics:** `get_app_analytics(app_id)`, `get_hub_analytics()`
  - **Environment:** `get_app_env(app_id)`, `set_app_env(app_id, key, value)`, `delete_app_env(app_id, key)`
  - **Tags & Filtering:** `list_tags()`, `filter_apps_by_tag(tag)`
  - **Favorites & Recent:** `get_favorite_apps()`, `get_recent_apps()`, `toggle_favorite(app_id, is_favorite)`
  - **Details & Status:** `get_app_detail(app_id)`, `get_app_status(app_id)`, `get_app_scripts(app_id)`, `get_port_assignments()`
  - **System:** `stop_all_apps()`, `refresh_app_discovery()`, plus registries and manifests
- **Dual-mode unchanged:** All functions work as Python imports (for workflows) and via MCP server (for Tauri GUI, external clients).
- **Workflow integration:** All 35 tools in the `ACTIONS` dict; register new tools in MCP server via `@server.list_tools()` and `@server.call_tool()`.
- **Implementation:** `tools/hub_mcp.py` extended with 400+ lines of new functions; `tools/HUB_MCP_EXTENDED.md` summarizes; see `docs/hub-mcp-tools.md` for full reference.
- **Next:** Ready for Tauri GUI Phase 2 — interview needed on how to display analytics, logs, env vars, scripts, and favorites in the sidebar layout.
- Verified: All functions degrade gracefully (Hub unreachable returns `{"available": False, "error": ...}`); no breaking changes to existing ACTIONS.

## 2026-06-17 — Agent can run terminal commands (`run_shell`) — allowlist-auto, approve-the-rest

- **New capability.** The governing agent (Osa) can now run terminal commands and
  show the result inline in the chat. New `run_shell(command)` tool on the
  governor toolbox (11 tools); output (stdout+stderr + exit code) returns as the
  tool result, so it renders seamlessly in the conversation like any other tool.
- **Safety policy (per decision: allowlist-auto, approve-the-rest).**
  - Read-only, single, un-chained commands (`ls`, `cat`, `pwd`, `grep`, `find`,
    `df`, `git status/log/diff`, …) run immediately — no approval.
  - Anything else — or any command containing shell chaining/redirect/
    substitution (`;`, `&&`, `|`, `>`, `` ` ``, `$(`) — routes through the
    existing HITL approval queue (new `shell_exec` entry in
    `config/constitution.yaml > approval_required`), surfacing an Allow/Deny
    prompt in the chat.
  - The Constitution's blocked-pattern list (`rm -rf`, `mkfs`, `> /dev/`, …) is
    enforced on **every** command, allowlisted or not — hard `BLOCKED`.
  - Commands run in the user's **home directory**, 30s timeout, output truncated
    to 4 000 chars.
- **Implementation (`agents/governor.py`).** `_is_safe_shell` (metachar-aware
  allowlist), `_exec_shell` (one-shot `subprocess`), `run_shell` reuses
  `_guarded`/`_run` so it shares the Constitution + approval plumbing. Added to
  the system-prompt request→tool map ("run <command>" → run_shell).
- Verified (sandbox): allowlist classifier (safe vs unsafe inc. `ls; curl|sh`
  style bypass attempts → approval path); allowlisted runs w/o approval; blocked
  pattern refused; non-allowlisted approve→runs / deny→DENIED-and-NOT-executed
  (marker-file check); empty rejected. `py_compile` + YAML clean. Sidecar restart
  picks it up (Python-only; no Tauri rebuild).

## 2026-06-17 — GUI fix: paste/copy/cut don't work in text inputs — add native Edit menu

- **Bug.** Pasting (Cmd+V) into the Agent prompt box did nothing. On macOS the
  standard editing shortcuts (Cmd+X/C/V/A, undo/redo) are delivered to the
  focused webview control via the app's **Edit-menu items carrying the predefined
  edit roles**. The native menu (`gui/desktop/src-tauri/src/lib.rs`) had App /
  File / View / Agent / Window but **no Edit menu**, so the webview inputs never
  received those commands.
- **Fix.** Added an Edit submenu (undo, redo, ─, cut, copy, paste, select-all via
  `PredefinedMenuItem`) in the conventional position between File and View. This
  is app-wide, so every text input benefits (Agent prompt, terminal, future
  inputs). The `on_menu_event` `match` already has a catch-all, so the role-based
  items need no handler changes.
- Rust change — needs a Tauri rebuild to take effect (`npm run tauri dev`); a JS
  reload alone won't pick up `lib.rs`.

## 2026-06-17 — Soul + Memory: persistent agent identity & memory across sessions/models

- **Idea.** Keep the agent's identity ("Osa") and durable memory intact across
  sessions AND across whichever model is active (local/cloud), via two
  human-editable Markdown files.
- **Files.** `config/Soul.md` (identity: name, who it serves, personality, voice,
  memory policy — migrated from the old `Soul.yaml`) and `config/Memory.md`
  (durable facts, append-only Log). The old `.yaml` versions are superseded; the
  loader prefers `.md` and falls back to `.yaml`, so they're harmless until
  deleted (the sandbox mount can't unlink them — `rm config/Soul.yaml
  config/Memory.yaml` on the Mac).
- **Loader (`core/soul.py`, new).** `load_soul()` / `load_memory()` /
  `identity_preamble()` compose a Soul+Memory block; `remember(note)` appends a
  timestamped line to `Memory.md` (append-only, bounded to that file, scaffolds
  the header on first write). Loaded fresh each turn ⇒ model-agnostic, survives
  restarts.
- **Injection (all LLM-facing agents).** `governor.build_agent` prepends the
  preamble to the system prompt (order: identity → governor system → tool
  roster), and `briefing_agent.compose_brief` prepends it to its system. The
  other agents (brain2/shell/hub) are deterministic and don't prompt a model.
- **Memory writes = automatic (per decision).** New `remember` tool on the
  governor toolbox (10 tools now) writes memory WITHOUT an approval gate — the
  agent persists facts on its own; bounded to `Memory.md`.
- Verified (sandbox): `.md`-preferred resolution, preamble merge, `remember`
  append + fresh-file scaffold + empty-note rejection + `.yaml` fallback, and the
  real `Soul.md`/`Memory.md` rendering into the composed governor prompt in the
  right order. `py_compile` clean. Live GUI check Mac-pending (restart sidecar).

## 2026-06-17 — Phase 10 Agent: "no tools available" — probe + prompt hardening (live-verification finding)

- Reported on a **local** model: the agent said it had no tools. Wiring is
  actually correct (`build_agent` → `create_react_agent(model, tools,
  prompt=...)`, which binds tools; `prompt=` is right for the installed
  langgraph 1.2.4). Prime suspect: a small local model answering in prose / not
  emitting tool calls.
- **Diagnose (`scripts/diagnose_tools.py`, new).** Binds the real governor tools
  to a given model (active by default; takes a model id arg) and prints the
  decisive signal — whether the BOUND model emits `tool_calls` for "list my
  workflows" / "system status", whether `bind_tools` attaches, whether Ollama's
  `/api/show` advertises a `tools` capability for that model, and a full
  `create_react_agent` turn. Interpretation guide included (local-empty +
  cloud-emits ⇒ capability gap; empty everywhere / TypeError ⇒ binding/version).
- **Harden (`agents/governor.py`).** `build_agent` now injects an explicit tool
  manifest (name + one-line description of every bound tool) into the system
  prompt via `_prompt_with_tool_manifest`, telling the model it DOES have tools
  and to never claim otherwise. Helps regardless of the probe outcome; verified
  formatting in isolation.
- **Result (probe run on the Mac 2026-06-17):** tools work end-to-end on BOTH
  models. qwen2.5-7B — Ollama advertises `['completion','tools']`, `bind_tools`
  attaches, and the bound model emits the correct `tool_calls`
  (`list_workflows`/`get_status`); the full `create_react_agent` turn invoked
  `list_workflows` and answered correctly. claude-sonnet-4-6 — identical (also
  reconfirms the issue-#2 cloud fix). So there is **no capability gap and no
  binding bug**; the GUI "no tools" was the pre-hardening prose behavior / a
  stale sidecar. Fix = the injected tool manifest + restarting the sidecar to
  load it. The optional local-tool fallback / auto-escalate are **not needed**.

## 2026-06-17 — Phase 10 Agent fix: persistent chat transcript (live-verification finding)

- **Bug.** The Agent chat "refreshed" after each Q&A round — earlier turns
  vanished. Root cause: `AgentView` re-derived the whole transcript every render
  from the global AG-UI `feed`, which is capped at the last 200 events
  (`slice(-200)`) and shared with workflow events. Replies stream **one
  `TEXT_MESSAGE_CONTENT` event per token**, so a single answer overran the window
  and evicted the `RUN_STARTED` markers that anchor each turn — `buildTranscript`
  could no longer reconstruct them, so prior turns (and sometimes the current one)
  disappeared.
- **Fix (`gui/desktop/src/App.jsx`).** Replaced the per-render `buildTranscript`
  with an incremental `foldAgentEvent(acc, evt)` that accumulates turns into
  **persistent App-level state** (`agentTurns`, fed as events arrive in the shared
  `connectAgui` handler, keyed by the unique `agt-<uuid>` run_id). `AgentView`
  now reads `ctx.agentTurns` instead of folding the sliced feed. The log is no
  longer subject to the 200-event cap and now also survives switching away from
  and back to the Agent view. The global `feed` (Workflows/SysOps) is unchanged.
- Verified: a 300-token reply across two turns retains **both** turns (user text,
  tool chips, status, tokens) and ignores non-`agt-` workflow events;
  `@babel/parser` parse clean. Backend already assigns a unique run_id per turn
  and includes `message`/`model` in `RUN_STARTED`, so user bubbles + model badge
  populate.

## 2026-06-17 — Phase 10: fix cloud "Connection error" — pin the Anthropic endpoint (Open issue #2)

- **Root cause (diagnosed, not guessed).** `scripts/diagnose_cloud.py` showed the
  shell exports `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:12434` and
  `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN=ollama` (to route *other* tools through local Ollama).
  `ChatAnthropic()` was built with no explicit `base_url`/`api_key`, so the
  anthropic SDK read those ambient vars and sent "cloud" requests to
  **localhost:12434** — returning `404 model 'claude-sonnet-4-6' not found` when
  Ollama was up, and the original `APIConnectionError` when it wasn't. Direct
  curl + httpx to the real API returned 200, isolating it to SDK env inheritance.
- **Fix (`core/llm.py`).** The cloud path is now self-contained: `get_chat_model`
  pins `base_url` (new `anthropic_base_url()`, configurable via
  `settings.agent.anthropic_base_url`, default `https://api.anthropic.com`) and
  passes `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` explicitly, and constructs the client inside
  `_isolated_anthropic_env()` — a context manager that strips
  `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`/`ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` for the duration of the build and
  restores them immediately after, so Claude Code / the user's shell are
  unaffected. Local (Ollama) routing is unchanged.
- **`config/settings.yaml`.** New `agent.anthropic_base_url` (documented; only
  change to intentionally front Anthropic with a gateway).
- **`scripts/diagnose_cloud.py`.** Added repo-root to `sys.path` (section 6 now
  runs) and an explicit warning when `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` is set.
- Verified (sandbox, fake `langchain_anthropic`): client pinned to the official
  URL with the key passed; ambient `ANTHROPIC_*` stripped during construction and
  restored after. `py_compile` clean. Live cloud reply in the GUI is Mac-pending.

## 2026-06-17 — Phase 10: dynamic Ollama discovery + auto-start + RAM gating; governor tool-first prompt (Open issue #3)

- **Auto-start Ollama (`core/llm.ensure_ollama_running`).** `GET /api/agent/models`
  now brings the service up before listing: if `/api/tags` doesn't answer, the
  sidecar spawns `ollama serve` (detached, new session) and waits up to 8s. The
  child inherits `OLLAMA_HOST` (and we derive `host:port` from `ollama_base_url()`
  when it's unset), so it binds the user's custom port (:12434). Binary located
  via PATH + Homebrew/`/usr/local`/Ollama.app fallbacks. Pass `?start=false` for
  a cheap read-only poll.
- **Dynamic model discovery (`discover_ollama`).** The dropdown now reflects
  *every* pulled model from `/api/tags`, not just the four configured in
  settings.yaml. Curated models keep their labels/metadata; others are added
  with sensible defaults (local ⇒ cost 0). 5s TTL cache. `get_model_info` /
  `set_active_model` resolve discovered ids too (force a re-discover on miss), so
  a just-pulled model is selectable and runnable; `cost_usd` correctly returns 0
  for discovered locals (no cloud-price fallback).
- **RAM comfort gating.** Each local model carries `size_bytes` / `ram_required_bytes`
  / `fits`; a model is `available` only if it needs **< half** of total RAM
  (`total_ram_bytes()` via psutil → `sysctl hw.memsize` → `/proc/meminfo`).
  Oversized models show disabled with a `too_large` reason + size. When Ollama is
  offline, locals report `ollama_off` (authoritative liveness check, so a stale
  discovery cache never looks runnable).
- **Frontend (`App.jsx`/`App.css`).** Dropdown options gain size suffixes and
  reason-aware labels (`(Ollama offline)` / `(not installed)` / `(too large · N GB)`
  / `(no API key)`); the issue-#1 hint and auto-fallback reuse the same
  `available` flag, so they now also respect RAM fit and liveness.
- **Issue #3 — governor tool-first prompt (`agents/governor.GOVERNOR_SYSTEM`).**
  Added an explicit "use tools, do not guess" section with a request→tool map, to
  stop small local models (qwen2.5-7B) answering in prose instead of calling
  `list_workflows`/`get_status`/etc. Escalate-to-cloud remains the fallback.
- Verified (sandbox, stubbed `/api/tags` + RAM): RAM gate at 16/8 GB, discovered-
  model select + zero local cost, Ollama-down → `ollama_off`, `OLLAMA_HOST=:12434`
  resolution. `py_compile` + `@babel/parser` clean. Live GUI + real `ollama serve`
  spawn are Mac-pending.

## 2026-06-17 — Phase 10 Agent UX fix: guard Send against unavailable models (Open issue #1)

- `AgentView` (`gui/desktop/src/App.jsx`) no longer lets a message be sent while
  the active model is unavailable. The default model can be a local model that
  isn't installed (or a cloud model with no API key); previously the dropdown
  `<option>` was disabled but the active model still defaulted to it and **Send
  stayed enabled**, so a click went to a dead model.
  - Derived `activeAvailable` from `activeInfo.available`; Send button, the
    `send()` handler, and the textarea are all gated on it (textarea also dims
    while unavailable).
  - Auto-fallback: when the active model is unavailable, fall back **once** to
    the first available *local* model. We never silently jump to a cloud model
    (would incur cost) — instead the user escalates explicitly.
  - Surfaced a `.agent-hint` line explaining *why* it's blocked and what to do
    ("…isn't installed — pull it with Ollama" / "No API key… set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY").
  - Verified: `@babel/parser` parse of `App.jsx` clean. Live GUI check Mac-pending.

## 2026-06-14 — NF-3 fix: honor OLLAMA_HOST in the LLM layer

- `core/llm.ollama_base_url()` now reads the standard `OLLAMA_HOST` env var
  first (normalizing bare-port / host:port / URL forms, mapping 0.0.0.0→
  127.0.0.1), falling back to `settings.yaml > agent.ollama_base_url` then the
  :11434 default. Fixes the sidecar looking at :11434 while the user's Ollama
  (and pulled models) run on a custom port — local models showed "not
  installed" and chat 404'd. Found during the 10c Mac smoke test.

## 2026-06-14 — Phase 10 (NF-3) sub-phase 10c — Agent dashboard + authoring 🟡 IN PROGRESS

> **Git-history note (Open issue #4):** the 10c code actually landed inside commit
> `0270602`, whose message reads "10a+10b" — the log understates it. History is
> left unrewritten; this note is the source of truth: **commit `0270602` = 10a +
> 10b + 10c.**

Put a GUI on the 10a/10b governing agent and added self-authoring tools. Code
complete + sandbox-verified; live model run is Mac-pending (needs LangChain +
Ollama/cloud).

- **FR-56 Agent dashboard (`gui/desktop/src/App.jsx`):** new `AgentView`
  registered as the seventh entry in the Phase 8 `VIEWS` registry — a **nav link,
  not an always-on panel** (GUI principle #7). It renders a chat transcript +
  input, a streamed assistant reply, a per-step tool-call trace
  (`TOOL_CALL_START`/`END` chips with running/done/error state), inline approval
  prompts (Allow/Deny → `POST /api/approvals/{id}` via `ctx.decide`), and a
  model-selector dropdown (`GET /api/agent/models` + `POST /api/agent/model`)
  with a clear local/cloud badge. The transcript is reconstructed from the shared
  AG-UI feed by filtering `run_id`s that start with `agt-`; messages are sent via
  `POST /api/agent/chat`, whose output streams back over that same feed (no
  second socket). Native View-menu entry **⌘7** added in `src-tauri/src/lib.rs`
  via the existing generic `view-<id>` pattern; styles in `App.css`.
- **FR-58 Escalate to cloud:** a per-conversation toggle in the agent bar that
  switches the active model between the first available local and cloud model
  mid-session (same model endpoints). The ReAct loop guard
  (`MAX_TOOL_ITERATIONS`) already lives in `agent_runner.py`.
- **FR-59 Authoring (`agents/governor.py`):** two new guarded tools —
  `write_config(filename, content)` (writes a YAML file into the OS config dir)
  and `edit_workflow(name, definition_json)` (adds/replaces one workflow in
  `config/workflows.yaml`, preserving the rest). Both go through
  `_authoring_write`: (1) `constitution.guard_write_path()` allowlist check →
  `BLOCKED`; (2) blocked-substring guard; (3) **always require human approval,
  regardless of the active model or the `approval_required` config**; (4) YAML is
  validated *before* approval is requested; (5) a timestamped `.bak` backup of any
  existing file is written before saving. Registered in `build_tools` (now 9
  tools) and described in `GOVERNOR_SYSTEM`.
- **Verified (sandbox):** `py_compile` clean on the changed `.py`; esbuild JSX
  transform of `App.jsx` bundles clean; 23 unit checks pass for the authoring
  tools (new-write/backup/overwrite, invalid-YAML rejection without approval,
  denial blocks write, bad extension, outside-allowlist `BLOCKED`,
  `edit_workflow` preserve + backup + bad-input paths, `build_tools` exposes both
  new tools = 9 total). **Mac-pending:** live agent turn driving the dashboard
  (stream + tool trace + approval round-trip), and an authoring round-trip
  (`write_config`/`edit_workflow` approval → backup → save) end-to-end.

## 2026-06-14 — Phase 10 (NF-3) sub-phase 10b — governing agent (headless) 🟡 IN PROGRESS

Built the governing agent + HITL + streaming endpoint on top of 10a. Headless
(no GUI yet — that's 10c). Live agent run is Mac-pending (needs LangChain +
a model).

- **FR-54 Governing agent (`agents/governor.py`):** `GovernorToolbox` exposes
  seven guarded tools wrapping existing capability — `list_workflows`,
  `run_workflow` (via the threaded runner, so it keeps its own step approvals),
  `list_tools`/`call_tool` (dynamic `tool_registry`), `list_agent_actions`,
  `get_status`, `get_runs`. `build_agent()` lazily builds a LangGraph
  `create_react_agent` over `llm.get_chat_model()` + these tools with the
  `GOVERNOR_SYSTEM` prompt. The toolbox is a plain object (no LangChain at
  import) so it's fully unit-testable.
- **FR-55 Constitution + HITL:** all side-effectful tool calls route through
  `GovernorToolbox._guarded` → `constitution.guard(action_type, payload)`.
  `ConstitutionViolation` → `BLOCKED:`; `ApprovalRequired` → bridged to a human
  via an injected `approval_fn`, then re-guarded `approved=True`. `call_tool` is
  classed as `api_call_external` (approval-required). Per-turn token + cloud-cost
  budgets enforced after the turn (local = 0).
- **FR-57 Agent runner + streaming (`gui/sidecar/agent_runner.py`):**
  session-scoped `AgentRunner` runs each turn on a worker thread and streams
  `RUN_STARTED` / `TEXT_MESSAGE_CONTENT` / `TOOL_CALL_START`/`END` /
  `APPROVAL_REQUIRED` / `RUN_FINISHED`/`RUN_ERROR` over the `events.py` bus.
  Token streaming via `stream_mode="messages"` with an `invoke()` fallback.
  **HITL is unified with workflows:** agent approvals are parked in the shared
  `runner.approvals` queue and resolved by the existing `POST /api/approvals/{id}`.
- **FR-57 endpoints (`gui/sidecar/app.py`):** `POST /api/agent/chat` (headless
  trigger → `turn_id`) and `WS /ws/agent` (inbound `{message, model?,
  session_id?}` starts a turn; outbound the AG-UI event stream with history
  replay).
- **Verified (sandbox, langgraph installed; no model call):** toolbox
  guard/deny/block/approve + event hooks, invalid-args + unknown-workflow paths,
  `build_tools` → 7 named/described StructuredTools, `agent_runner` imports
  clean, `py_compile` clean on all changed files. **Mac-pending:** live turn via
  a local model (tool call + approval round-trip over `/ws/agent`); confirm
  agent approvals appear in `/api/approvals`. Next: **10c** (Agent dashboard).

## 2026-06-14 — Phase 10 (NF-3) sub-phase 10a — unified LLM layer 🟡 IN PROGRESS

Started NF-3 with sub-phase **10a** (foundational, depends only on NF-2 which is
done — NOT on NF-4). Headless LLM provider layer + model registry; no GUI yet.

- **FR-52 Unified LLM provider layer (`core/llm.py`):** one seam over cloud
  (Anthropic) + local (Ollama) via LangChain (`ChatAnthropic`/`ChatOllama`,
  lazy-imported so the module loads without the packages). Model registry
  (`ModelInfo`), alias→id `resolve()` (`default`/`fast`/`local`), active-model
  session state (`active_model`/`set_active_model`), `is_available()`
  (cloud=API key, local=Ollama tag), `cost_usd()` (local priced 0; unknown
  cloud → most-expensive rate, conservative), and `complete()` returning text +
  token + cost accounting via `usage_metadata`.
- **FR-52 briefing refactor:** `agents/briefing_agent.compose_brief` now routes
  through `core/llm.py` — single LLM entry point. Template fallback now triggers
  on `llm.is_available(model)` (covers both no-API-key cloud and Ollama-down
  local), not just a bare API-key check. Removed the agent's local `_cost_usd`
  (moved to `llm.cost_usd`).
- **FR-53 Model registry + runtime switch:** `config/settings.yaml > agent`
  (default_model = local `qwen2.5:7b-instruct`, `ollama_base_url`, model
  registry of 2 cloud + 2 local with `cost_per_mtok`). Added local pricing
  entries (0) + a `local` alias. New endpoints in `gui/sidecar/app.py`:
  `GET /api/agent/models` (cloud + installed Ollama, `active`/`installed`/
  `available` flags) and `POST /api/agent/model {id}` (sets active model).
- **Deps:** `langchain-core`, `langchain-anthropic`, `langchain-ollama` added to
  `requirements.txt` (not yet `pip install`-ed on the Mac venv).
- **Verified (sandbox, no LangChain needed — lazy):** registry/resolve/cost/
  active-model/`list_models`/`is_available` + briefing template fallback all
  pass; `py_compile` clean on all three files.
- **Pending on the Mac:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`; `ollama serve` +
  pull `qwen2.5:7b-instruct` & `llama3.1:8b`; register **:11434** in
  `~/Codehome/hub/docs/PORT_ASSIGNMENTS.md` (TR-10); ruff; live briefing via a
  local model + `/api/agent/models` smoke test. Next: **10b** (FR-54/55/57).

## 2026-06-14 — Phase 8 (NF-2) Dashboard Workspace ✅ COMPLETE

- **FR-46 Dashboard registry:** `VIEWS` in `gui/desktop/src/App.jsx` is now the
  single source of truth (`{id,label,component,badge?,placeholder?,purpose?}`);
  nav and the native menu derive from it.
- **FR-47 SysOps rename:** former "Dashboard" 6-panel grid → `SysOpsView`
  (id `sysops`, keeps the approvals badge). Migration shim on
  `localStorage["agentic-os.activeView"]`: `dashboard`→`sysops`,
  `events`→`workflows`, so existing installs don't open to a dead view.
- **FR-48 Combined Workflows dashboard:** new `WorkflowsDashboard` reuses the
  Phase 7 `Panel` expand/collapse — a Workflows panel (definitions, each row
  expandable to recent runs from `/api/runs`, with run button) + an Events panel
  (the AG-UI feed, each line tagged with `workflow` + short `run_id`). Standalone
  Events nav entry removed. Front-end-only — no sidecar changes.
- **FR-49 Bidirectional linking:** `selectedWorkflow`/`selectedRunId` lifted to
  the dashboard. Click workflow → highlight its events; click run → highlight
  that run's events; click event → select its run + scroll the matching workflow
  row into view; clear → unfiltered live feed. Highlight is visual only (no
  refetch; keys already in `feed`).
- **FR-50 Placeholders:** Web News, Scripts, Zsh Config Editor, Obsidian Viewer
  registered, each rendering a shared `ComingSoon` stub (title + purpose).
- **FR-51 Menu sync:** `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` View submenu lists the six
  dashboards (⌘1–6) + Reload (⌘R); handler is generic (`view-<id>` → registry id)
  so future dashboards only need a registry + menu-item pair.
- Verified: `App.jsx` passes an esbuild JSX transform; new highlight/stub styles
  added to `App.css`.

## 2026-06-14 — Next batch scoped: priorities locked, PRD staged (Phases 8–10)

- New feature intake captured in `docs/feature-backlog.md` (NF-1…NF-4).
- **NF-1** (host on GitHub) ✅ done — public repo `tseneadza/AgenticOS`.
- Priorities **locked**: NF-2 → Phase 8, NF-4 → Phase 9, NF-3 → Phase 10.
- Detailed specs written for **NF-2** (FR-46–51) and **NF-3** (FR-52–59);
  **NF-4** (FR-60–64) staged provisionally, pending a detailed drill-down.
- PRD update **staged** in `docs/PRD-addendum-phases-8-10.md` (paste into the
  Brain2 Full PRD — vault not accessible from this workspace).
- `docs/roadmap.md` extended with Planned Phases 8–10. Planning/docs only — no
  behavior change.

## 2026-06-14 — Phases 4, 5, 6 signed off ✅ COMPLETE

- **Phase 4 — Shell Integration:** verification checklist passed (ZSH plugin
  installed + shell reloaded, sidecar launched, `cd` into a Codehome project
  surfaced `cd` events and the Brain2 context log in the Tauri terminal strip).
- **Phase 5 — Brain2 Workflow Agents:** verification checklist passed
  (`core.scheduler install` loaded the launchd plists, `process-raw-notes`
  classified and moved a raw note, `save-session` wrote a report to
  `04 - Reflections/`).
- **Phase 6 — Codehome Deep Integration:** verification checklist passed
  (`hub-status` returned the live app list, an `app.json` `"agent"` block
  surfaced in the manifest endpoint, `tools.hub_mcp` stdio server started clean).
- `docs/roadmap.md` markers flipped from 🟩 IMPLEMENTED to ✅ COMPLETE (dated
  2026-06-14), signed off by Tony. No code changes — verification/sign-off only.

## 2026-06-13 — Phase 7: Expandable Panels + Native Menu Bar + Interactive Terminal

### Phase 7 — Expandable Panels (FR-40–44)

- **Panel expand/collapse (FR-40–41):** Double-click any panel title bar to expand it to the full
  dashboard content area. `Escape` or double-clicking again collapses back to the grid. Only one
  panel can be expanded at a time. A smooth 150ms CSS animation (`@keyframes panel-expand`)
  handles the transition. Implementation: `.panel.expanded` uses `position: absolute; inset: 0;
  z-index: 10` within the `.grid { position: relative }` container so the native sidebar stays
  visible. `.grid.has-expanded { overflow: hidden }` prevents scroll bleed.
- **Two-layout data contracts (FR-42):** Each panel exposes a `condensed` view (grid default) and
  an `expanded` view with richer data. No new backend endpoints — expanded views re-use the same
  polling endpoints, just render more of the response.
- **Expanded layout per panel (FR-43):**
  - *System Health* — two-column stat grid + per-core CPU bar chart (8 cores visualised). Requires
    `cpu_per_core` field added to `panels.iterm_strip()` via `psutil.cpu_percent(percpu=True)`.
    Top-10 process table (bumped from 5).
  - *Agent Activity* — full run history table with cost, duration, status columns.
  - *Keno Telemetry* — sparkline-style gap coverage + last 20 draws table.
  - *Codehome Hub* — full app table with agent-manifest inline rows + scripts list.
  - *Approval Queue* — card layout with full action description and approve/deny buttons.
  - *Terminal* — full xterm.js interactive PTY (see below).
- **localStorage persistence (FR-44):** `localStorage["agentic-os.expandedPanel"]` stores the
  last-expanded panel; app reopens in that state. `Escape` always resets.
- CSS additions: `.exp-grid-2`, `.exp-col`, `.exp-section-title`, `.core-bars`, `.core-bar-wrap`,
  `.bar.inline-bar`, and expanded-view overrides for each panel. Terminal override:
  `.panel.expanded .panel-body:has(.term-xterm) { padding: 0; overflow: hidden }`.

### Native App Menu Bar (FR-45)

- **Tauri v2 native menu** (`src-tauri/src/lib.rs`): Full macOS app menu bar with five submenus:
  - *Agentic OS* — About, Preferences (⌘,), Services, separator, Hide/Hide Others/Show All,
    separator, Quit (⌘Q).
  - *File* — New Run (⌘N), Close Window (⌘W).
  - *View* — Dashboard (⌘1), Workflows (⌘2), Events (⌘3), separator, Reload (⌘R).
  - *Agent* — Run Morning Briefing, separator, Restart Sidecar.
  - *Window* — Minimize (⌘M), Zoom, standard Window items.
- **Menu → React routing:** Menu item events call `window.eval("window.__agenticOsSetView(viewId)")`
  from Rust. React exposes `window.__agenticOsSetView` in a `useEffect` in `App.jsx` that calls
  `setView()` — no `@tauri-apps/api` npm package required.
- **Restart Sidecar:** kills the running sidecar process, waits 600ms, then re-spawns it —
  equivalent to the CLI `agentic-gui restart`.
- Uses local variable binding pattern throughout (`let quit = PredefinedMenuItem::quit(app, None)?;`
  etc.) to satisfy Rust borrow checker lifetime requirements with Tauri v2's menu API.

### Interactive Terminal — xterm.js + PTY (FR-33 enhanced)

- **`gui/sidecar/terminal.py`** (new): Async PTY WebSocket handler at `/ws/terminal`.
  - Spawns `$SHELL -l` in a pseudo-terminal using `pty.openpty()` +
    `asyncio.create_subprocess_exec` with `slave_fd` as stdin/stdout/stderr, `preexec_fn=os.setsid`
    for proper session handling.
  - `asyncio.StreamReader` + `loop.add_reader(master_fd)` for non-blocking PTY reads without
    threading.
  - Binary WebSocket frames = keystroke bytes (PTY → WS and WS → PTY). JSON text frames with
    `{"type":"resize","cols":N,"rows":N}` → `fcntl.ioctl(fd, TIOCSWINSZ, ...)` for live resize.
  - `TERM=xterm-256color`, `COLORTERM=truecolor` set in child env; oh-my-posh and full-colour
    prompts render correctly.
  - Graceful cleanup: `loop.remove_reader`, close `master_fd`, `proc.kill()`, `proc.wait()`.
- **`gui/sidecar/app.py`**: Added `@app.websocket("/ws/terminal")` route delegating to
  `terminal_handler.handle(ws)`.
- **`App.jsx` — `TerminalStrip` component (rewritten)**:
  - Condensed view: same read-only strip of last N lines from `/api/panels/terminal`.
  - Expanded view: dynamically imports `@xterm/xterm` + `@xterm/addon-fit` (code-split by Vite,
    ~329KB loaded only on first expand). Opens an xterm.js terminal, connects via
    `WebSocket("ws://localhost:5130/ws/terminal")`, maps `onData` → WS binary send. `ResizeObserver`
    calls `fitAddon.fit()` and sends a JSON resize frame on every container size change.
  - Session-end banner written to terminal on WS close.
  - Cleanup on collapse: `ResizeObserver.disconnect()`, `ws.close()`, `term.dispose()`.
- **xterm.js deps added**: `@xterm/xterm@6.0.0`, `@xterm/addon-fit@0.11.0` in `package.json`.
  `import "@xterm/xterm/css/xterm.css"` in `App.jsx`.

### Sidecar enhancements

- **`panels.py`**: `system_health()` now returns `cpu_per_core: [float, ...]` — one value per
  logical CPU via `psutil.cpu_percent(percpu=True)`. Top-processes list bumped from 5 → 10.
  `/api/panels/terminal` passes `limit` query param through to `iterm_strip(lines=limit)`.

# Changelog

All notable changes to the Agentic OS. Newest first.

## 2026-06-13 — Phase 6: Codehome Deep Integration (FR-17–19)

- **Hub MCP wrapper (FR-17):** `tools/hub_mcp.py` — dual-mode module: plain
  Python functions importable by any module, plus a stdio MCP server
  (`python -m tools.hub_mcp`) for LangGraph tool-protocol use (TR-11).
  Exposes `list_hub_apps`, `start_hub_app`, `stop_hub_app`, `restart_hub_app`,
  `hub_app_action`, and `hub_status`. Normalises both flat and nested Hub API
  response shapes transparently.
- **Agent-block auto-registration (FR-18):** `get_app_manifest(app_id)` fetches
  the `"agent"` block from a Codehome app's `app.json` — tries Hub API endpoints
  first, falls back to `~/Codehome/**/app.json` filesystem scan.
  `build_agent_tool_registry()` scans all Hub apps and returns a callable tool dict;
  new apps appear automatically without manual registration.
  `hub_manifests()` (fast path) returns embedded manifest data from the card listing.
- **Scripts discovery (FR-19):** `list_hub_scripts()` queries `GET /api/scripts`;
  `build_script_tool_registry()` wraps each script as a `hub_script__<id>` tool.
  New Hub scripts appear in the registry on next `ToolRegistry.refresh()` call.
- **`core/tool_registry.py`:** `ToolRegistry` singleton aggregates script tools
  (FR-19), agent-block tools (FR-18), and static `config/tools.yaml` entries
  (highest priority). Refreshes at most once per 60s. `call(tool_name)` dispatches
  to the right backend. Module-level `get_registry()` returns the shared instance.
- **`agents/hub_agent.py`:** Simplified to re-export everything from `hub_mcp`
  — no direct `requests` calls remain in workflow code (TR-11 fully closed).
- **`gui/sidecar/panels.py`:** `hub_status()` and `hub_app_action()` now delegate
  to `hub_mcp`. New `hub_manifests()` and `hub_scripts()` panel functions added.
  Removed orphaned `HUB_URL` variable (no longer needed at panel level).
- **`gui/sidecar/app.py`:** Two new endpoints: `GET /api/panels/hub/manifests`
  (agent capability data, slow-poll) and `GET /api/panels/hub/scripts`.
- **`gui/desktop/src/App.jsx`:** HubPanel now fetches manifests at 60s interval.
  Added "Agent" column: apps with an agent block show a `✦ N` badge (N = tool count);
  clicking expands an inline manifest row showing `api_base` and all declared tools.
- **`config/workflows.yaml`:** Added `hub-status`, `hub-scripts`, and
  `hub-app-manifest` workflows for programmatic Hub introspection.

## 2026-06-13 — Phase 5: Brain2 Workflow Agents (FR-13–16)

- **`process-raw-notes` workflow (FR-13):** Two new `brain2_agent` actions —
  `scan_raw_notes` lists `.md` files in `00 - Raw/`; `process_each_raw_note`
  classifies each note by keyword heuristic (project/task/learning/reflection/
  resource/reference), adds YAML frontmatter if missing, writes to the target
  vault folder, and archives the original in `06 - Archive/processed-raw/`.
  Scheduled 9pm daily via launchd/APScheduler.
- **`research-learning-notes` workflow (FR-14):** `scan_learning_notes` finds
  notes in `02 - Learning/` with `status: processing`; `research_each_learning_note`
  updates frontmatter to `status: researched` and appends a `## Claude's Analysis`
  stub (full LLM research runs via `briefing_agent` in a follow-on step).
  Scheduled 10pm daily.
- **`save-session` workflow (FR-15):** `collect_session_summary` reads recent
  run history and active Brain2 projects; `write_session_report` writes a dated
  session report with workflow costs and a Next Day Focus template to
  `04 - Reflections/`. Manual trigger only.
- **`core/scheduler.py` (FR-16):** launchd plist generator — reads `workflows.yaml`
  schedules, converts 5-field cron to `StartCalendarInterval`, injects
  `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` from env or `~/.agentic-os/env.yaml` (chmod 600),
  loads plists via `launchctl`. CLI: `python -m core.scheduler install|uninstall|list`.
  APScheduler in-process fallback wired to sidecar startup for dev-mode scheduling.
- `config/workflows.yaml` — added `process-raw-notes`, `research-learning-notes`,
  `save-session` workflow definitions.

## 2026-06-13 — Phase 4: Shell Integration (FR-08–12)

- **iTerm2 Python API wrapper (FR-08, TR-08):** `tools/iterm2_tool.py` —
  `open_pane(commands)` opens a vertical split pane via `async_split_pane`
  and injects commands via `async_inject`; `read_pane()` returns last N
  lines of output. AppleScript cookie acquired once on first use, cached
  for the process lifetime. Sync wrappers (`run_in_pane`, `last_pane_lines`)
  for non-async workflow nodes.
- **ZSH plugin (FR-09, TR-09):** `shell/agentic-os.plugin.zsh` — registers
  `preexec`, `precmd`, and `chpwd` hooks. Each hook serialises a JSON event
  and sends it to the Unix socket via `socat` in one-shot mode (naturally
  reconnects on next event if the server restarts). Shell helpers: `aos-on`,
  `aos-off`, `aos-status`. Install: copy to
  `~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/agentic-os/` and add to `plugins=()`.
- **Unix socket server (FR-10, TR-09):** `core/socket_server.py` — asyncio
  server on `~/.agentic-os/shell.sock` (chmod 600). Maintains a 200-event
  ring buffer consumed by the terminal strip panel. Auto-started as a
  background task in the FastAPI sidecar (`app.py` startup event).
- **Directory-change Brain2 context (FR-11):** `agents/shell_agent.py` —
  `chpwd` events trigger a project map lookup (scans Brain2 `01 - Projects/`
  for `codehome_dir` / `dir` frontmatter). On match: logs project name,
  status, and linked-note count; emits a `context` event into the ring buffer.
- **Policy intercept (FR-12):** `open_pane` calls `constitution.guard(
  "shell_command", cmd)` for each command before `async_inject`. Blocked
  commands raise `ConstitutionViolation`; approval-gated ones raise
  `ApprovalRequired` (surfaced via the existing approval queue).
- **Terminal strip wired (FR-33):** `panels.iterm_strip` reads the socket
  ring buffer first; falls back to `~/.agentic-os/shell.log` for
  compatibility. Shows `$ cmd`, `← exit N`, `cd path`, and context events.
- `iterm2>=2.6` added to `requirements.txt`.

## 2026-06-12 — Phase 3: GUI Navigation Shell (FR-36–39)

- **Nav-only sidebar (FR-36)**: Workflows list and Event feed removed from
  the sidebar; it now holds brand, nav links, and sidecar status only.
  Approval-count badge shown on the Dashboard link.
- **View registry (FR-37)**: `VIEWS` array in `App.jsx` drives nav entries
  and routing — new paradigm = new nav link (design principle #7), never
  another always-on dashboard panel.
- **Workflows & Events views (FR-38)**: `WorkflowsView` — table with
  description, last run event, and run button; `EventsView` — full
  AG-UI feed (last 200 events) with auto-scroll.
- **Persisted active view (FR-39)**: stored in
  `localStorage["agentic-os.activeView"]`, validated against the registry;
  Dashboard remains the default. Brand bumped to v0.3.
- Dashboard's six Phase 2 panels are unchanged. Nav/view styles appended
  to `App.css`. Also: `CLAUDE.md` added (session-budget rule, conventions);
  `roadmap.md` renumbered to match the renumbered PRD (Shell→4, Brain2→5,
  Codehome→6).

## 2026-06-12 — Phase 2 punch list: production app

- **Sidecar auto-start/stop**: the Tauri app now spawns the venv sidecar on
  launch (skipped if :5130 is already serving, e.g. started by `agentic-gui`)
  and SIGKILLs it on exit. Spawns the venv python rather than a frozen
  binary — documented deviation from a bundled external binary.
- **App icon** (agent-graph motif) generated for all targets via `tauri icon`.
- **Production build**: `Agentic OS.app` (8.3 MB) + DMG via `npm run tauri
  build`; installed to `/Applications`. Verified: cold launch auto-starts
  sidecar; quit kills it, no zombies.
- `agentic-gui` hardening: uvicorn can hang in graceful shutdown when a
  WebSocket client was attached — kill_all now escalates to SIGKILL by
  process pattern, and patterns are self-exclusion-safe (`gui[.]sidecar`).
- Remaining from punch list: `text_delta` / `tool_call` event granularity
  (needs agent instrumentation).

## 2026-06-12 — `agentic-gui` launcher

- `scripts/agentic-gui.sh` (+ `agentic-gui` alias in `~/.zshrc`): one-command
  start/stop/status for the GUI. Start always kills stale processes first
  (by port 5130/1420 and by process name) so reruns never collide.
  Logs to `data/logs/{sidecar,tauri}.log`.

## 2026-06-12 — Phase 2: Tauri Desktop GUI + sidecar (initial build)

- **FastAPI sidecar** (`gui/sidecar/`, port 5130 — registered in
  `hub/docs/PORT_ASSIGNMENTS.md` per TR-10): REST endpoints for the six
  dashboard panels, workflow run/history/approval APIs, and an
  AG-UI-format WebSocket event stream at `/ws/agui` (FR-21).
- **Threaded workflow runner** with programmatic HITL: interrupts park on
  an approval queue resolved via `POST /api/approvals/{id}` instead of
  CLI `input()`; emits RUN_STARTED / STEP_FINISHED / APPROVAL_REQUIRED /
  APPROVAL_RESOLVED / RUN_FINISHED / RUN_ERROR events.
- **Tauri v2 + React desktop app** (`gui/desktop/`, FR-20) — Focused
  Sidebar layout with six panels: System Health (FR-28, psutil, 2s poll),
  Agent Activity (FR-29, run_history), Keno Telemetry (FR-30, MySQL),
  Codehome Hub with start/stop/restart (FR-31, 5s poll), Approval Queue
  (FR-32), Terminal strip (FR-33, stub until Phase 3).
- **TR-03 closed**: `tools/filesystem_tool.py` now delegates to a real MCP
  stdio client (`@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem` via npx, `mcp`
  Python SDK). Constitution guards remain client-side. New
  `settings.filesystem_backend` ("mcp" default, "direct" fallback).
  Residual deviation: `delete_file` stays direct (server has no delete tool).
- **FR-22**: Obsidian Dataview dashboard note added at
  `Brain2/01 - Projects/Agentic OS - Dashboard.md`.
- New deps: `mcp`, `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `psutil`, `mysql-connector-python`.
  Rust toolchain (rustup, minimal profile) installed for Tauri builds.

## 2026-06-11 — Daily cost cap enforcement

- `limits.max_cost_per_day_usd` is now enforced (was declared-only):
  pre-spend gate in `briefing_agent` before any API call, plus a post-step
  re-check in the orchestrator. Free template-mode runs are never blocked.
- Per-model pricing table added to `config/settings.yaml` (Sonnet 4.6
  $3/$15, Haiku 4.5 $1/$5 per MTok); unknown models billed at the most
  expensive listed rates.
- `run_history` gained a `cost_usd` column (auto-migrated); new
  `memory.cost_today()`; `agentic-os history` shows per-run cost and
  today's total spend.

## 2026-06-11 — Documentation suite

- Added `docs/`: usage guide, architecture, workflows reference,
  constitution reference, state & memory, roadmap, this changelog.
- Established the documentation policy: docs update in the same change
  that alters behavior.

## 2026-06-11 — Phase 1: Core Orchestration (initial build)

- LangGraph-based orchestrator building graphs from `config/workflows.yaml`.
- Workflows: `morning-briefing` (vault scan → Hub check → brief → write to
  `04 - Reflections/`), `approval-demo` (HITL demonstration).
- Agents: `brain2_agent`, `hub_agent`, `briefing_agent` (Claude API with
  template fallback when `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is unset).
- Agent constitution (`config/constitution.yaml`) enforced at the tool-call
  boundary: blocked patterns, approval-gated action types, write allowlist,
  token budget, file-write cap. Daily cost cap declared, not yet enforced.
- Human-in-the-loop interrupts via LangGraph `interrupt()` for
  `requires_approval: true` steps.
- SQLite state (`data/state.db`): LangGraph checkpoints + run history;
  `agentic-os history` command.
- CLI: `run`, `list`, `history`. Exit codes: 2 = constitution halt,
  3 = approval denied.
- Verified end-to-end on 2026-06-11 against the live Brain2 vault.
